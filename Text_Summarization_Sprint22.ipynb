            "The AMA continues to underscore our concerns regarding ongoing conversion factor reductions, specifically the proposed 3.36 percent reduction in the 2024 Medicare conversion factor (CF), with corresponding reductions in anesthesia CF rates. We are deeply concerned that these proposed cuts will have far-reaching implications for both physicians and the patients they serve.\n",
            "\n",
            "The proposed payment reductions are attributable to two factors, including a -1.25 percent reduction stemming from a temporary update and a negative budget neutrality adjustment linked to the introduction of an office visit add-on code. It is evident that these payment cuts are counterproductive to our shared goal of providing high-quality care to Medicare beneficiaries, and simultaneously eroding the financial sustainability of physician practices.\n",
            "\n",
            "The continued decline in payment rates is unsustainable. Over the period of 2001 to 2023, the cost of operating a medical practice has surged by 47 percent, while physician payment rates have increased by only nine percent. When adjusted for inflation, Medicare physician payment rates have plummeted by 26 percent, underscoring the magnitude of the discrepancy between costs and compensation, which is only projected to worsen next year. CMS estimates that the cost to practice medicine as measured by the government’s Medicare Economic Index (MEI) is 4.5 percent. This imbalance poses a serious threat to the stability and vitality of medical practices across the nation and contributes to high rates of burnout among physicians.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Worse, the AMA is hearing that more physicians and group practices will be hit with a MIPS penalty in 2024 based on the newly released 2022 performance period feedback. These penalties can reduce Medicare payment by as much as -9 percent. The MIPS program was largely paused during the 2020 and 2021 performance periods due to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE), and we have serious concerns that it may be unfairly penalizing physician practices—particularly small, independent, and rural practices—due to a lack of awareness of the expiration of the automatic COVID-19 flexibilities. Further, there is growing evidence that this program is unduly burdensome, completely divorced from quality improvement, and exacerbating health inequities. When finalizing its proposals, CMS must consider the totality of the payment reductions facing physicians in 2024.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Moreover, such reductions in physician payment rates will severely hamper access to care for Medicare patients. The Medicare Trustees have explicitly warned that access to Medicare-participating physicians could be seriously compromised in the long term if payment rates fail to adapt. Delays in care, particularly in underserved populations, are associated with worse health outcomes and inequitable health care delivery. It is our shared responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent such outcomes.\n",

            "While we appreciate that Congress partially mitigated the 4.5 percent cut to the MFS rates that was supposed to take effect in January 2023 through passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) of 2023, the forthcoming -1.25 percent reduction in 2024 that was included in the CAA, compounded by a two percent reduction that took effect for 2023, amplifies the financial stress on physician practices.

CMS also increased the valuation of hospital visits within maternity care codes, consistent with the RUC recommendation to increase visit valuation within all codes with a global period to be consistent with stand-alone evaluation and management visits. The AMA urges CMS to review the RUC and national specialty society comments on the specific codes for which CMS did not accept the relative value recommendations. We acknowledge CMS’s efforts to adopt certain recommendations from the RUC. However, we believe it is imperative to exercise careful deliberation to ensure that the valuation of codes accurately reflects the complexity and value of medical services provided.\n",

The MEI serves as a pivotal measure of practice cost inflation and forms the foundation for determining the proportion of payments allocated to physician earnings and practice costs. We are aligned with the necessity of basing MEI weights on reliable and contemporary data sources to ensure accuracy and fairness in rate-setting and urge the agency to continue to use AMA data for this purpose.\n",

            "Nonetheless, we must strongly echo the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the utilization assumptions for G2211, which are driving nearly all of the 2024 budget neutrality reduction proposed by CMS. The lack of clarity surrounding the appropriate circumstances for reporting this code, combined with potential implications for patient cost-sharing, has created significant ambiguity among health care practitioners. We urge the agency to further refine these assumptions to prevent unwarranted reductions in the Medicare conversion factor.\n",

We support CMS’s proposal to pause the implementation of the AUC Program and to rescind current program regulations until the necessary modifications can be made. The concerns surrounding the burden, technical challenges, and workflow disruptions associated with the AUC Program are well-founded, and we believe that physicians need flexibility in consulting physician- developed, evidence-based, and transparent AUC or advanced diagnostic imaging guidelines.

The value of telehealth services, particularly during the COVID-19 PHE, has been abundantly clear, and these flexibilities have enhanced patient access to care. We urge CMS to join efforts in supporting legislation for the permanent extension of Medicare telehealth policies. With regard to the policy clarifications on the reporting of codes for remote monitoring, we have outlined several recommendations to make the Medicare guidance more accurate and consistent with CPT, as well as to avoid imposing inappropriate restrictions on the use of these services.\n",

MedPAC raised concerns about the growing gap between what it costs to run a medical practice and what Medicare pays. While we recognize that CMS does not have the authority to provide an inflation-based update for physicians, we strongly urge the agency to use every policy lever available to reduce the proposed budget neutrality reduction for physician services in 2024 and to close the gap between the Medicare physician payment update and the rising cost of practicing medicine, which is estimated to increase by 4.5 percent next year.

We hope the agency will work with the AMA and Congress to seek this legislative relief.

Rather than estimating the costs of each resource on a per line-item basis, this ratio is an average at the hospital department level. Since the creation of the OPPS, this averaging mechanism has consistently resulted in charge compression. CMS defines charge compression as the “practice of applying a lower charge markup to higher cost services and a higher charge markup to lower cost services.” As a result, the cost-based weights may reflect some aggregation bias, undervaluing high-cost items and overvaluing low-cost items when an estimate of average markup, embodied in a single CCR, is applied to items of widely varying costs in the same cost center.\n",

However, in response to blanket opposition from organized medicine about the proposal to collapse the office visits, CMS ultimately abandoned that approach and instead adopted the CPT Editorial Panel’s revised coding guidelines for O/O E/M visits, as well as the RUC’s recommended increased valuation of those codes.

We have seen this with the other Medicare care management codes. Further, the expense will have a disproportionate impact on low-income patients. In addition, in a prior comment letter, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) raised the important question of how physicians will document that they are reporting G2211 appropriately without a more detailed description of the code. We have heard questions from physicians about how a single, serious condition will be defined.

For X2, a reporting clinician service example is a rheumatologist taking care of a patient’s rheumatoid arthritis longitudinally but not providing general primary care services.

In addition, this CMS guidance describes G2211 as a service that results in “a comprehensive, longitudinal, and continuous relationship with the patient and involve[s] delivery of team-based care that is accessible, coordinated with other practitioners and providers, and integrated with the broader health care landscape.” This guidance indicates that G2211 would involve team-based care and care coordination for the patient, both elements that go beyond the code descriptor and indicate that reporting of this code should be more discerning than CMS otherwise considers in this rule.\n",

Further, the clarifications have the potential to create unnecessary complexity in an innovative and rapidly evolving area of digital medicine and may prevent physicians from being able to access necessary services for their patients that could greatly improve patient outcomes. We also remind CMS that the CPT Editorial Panel process is a transparent, rigorous process that very deliberately and thoughtfully develops coding and guidelines that foster appropriate reporting. The CPT Editorial Panel delivers codes and guidelines that are well reasoned and vetted; if CMS wants to ensure appropriate access to remote monitoring services with the goal of higher quality patient care, there is no reason to implement clarifications that will limit use beyond what is stipulated in the CPT guidelines.\n",

Since CMS offered this clarification, it is logical that physicians should be able to utilize remote monitoring services for a new patient who presents with an acute illness. Limiting remote monitoring to only established patients is not only unnecessary but potentially dangerous. There is a wide range of acute symptoms that a new patient could present with from COVID-19 to heart failure and, in many cases, RPM is an important element of high- quality care and can also reduce the likelihood of additional costly care. In addition, a policy of excluding new patients assumes that the patient’s primary care physician is providing remote monitoring services themselves when we know that at many large health systems the primary care physician partners with a remote monitoring team. If the patient is required to be an established patient with the physician leading the remote patient monitoring program, that could create a separate and unnecessary intake visit after the patient’s primary care physician has already identified the need for remote monitoring services.\n",

The CPT guidelines are clear that the 16-day monitoring requirement only applies to RPM and RTM, which are the CPT codes for the practice expense of the clinical staff time to set-up and educate the patient on the device and the practice expense of the equipment to supply the patient with the remote monitoring device. RTMTM services are for the physician work and associated clinical staff time to analyze and implement the data collected from the patient through monitoring. CPT guidelines state that “remote therapeutic monitoring treatment management services are provided when a physician or other QHP uses the results of remote therapeutic monitoring to manage a patient under a specific treatment plan.” The CPT Editorial Panel carefully outlined the requirements to report treatment management services and they do not include at least 16 days of monitoring. This flexibility is intentional so that the physician or other QHP can provide the appropriate care to the patient and report the time that they spent on the patients care even when the physician practice does not provide the device and/or less than 16 days of monitoring takes place. Simply not meeting the requirements to report the device supply code should not prohibit the physician from reporting services performed when they spend at least 20 minutes of time in a calendar month on remote therapeutic monitoring treatment management.\n",

The AMA agrees with CMS that only one monitoring device should be reported regardless of the number of devices provided to the patient and the number of parameters monitored, however, this is for an episode of care for a specific condition, it is not intended to limit treatment for patients who see separate physicians for separate episodes of care and would benefit from medical device(s) to monitor separate and distinct episodes of care.

While we agree with CMS that remote monitoring may be furnished separately from a global service payment for a procedure or surgery, we strongly disagree that the diagnosis must be “…unrelated to the diagnosis for which the global procedure is performed….” or that the remote monitoring must be for “…an episode of care that is separate and distinct from the episode of care for the global procedure….” RPM, RPMTM, RTM and RTMTM services are not included in the services provided as part of the surgical global period and can be incredibly useful in post-surgical care.\n",

This type of service is typically excluded from the CMS global period for joint replacement surgery because the surgeon does not provide PT services. However, it is related to the diagnosis for which the global surgical period is applied and is part of the episode of care. Remote therapeutic monitoring of PT should be separately reportable even though it is related to the underlying condition that the global procedure addressed.\n",

Studies have found substantial evidence linking social circumstances, including access to healthy food, stable housing, and transportation, to health and to health outcomes. It is now understood that non-medical factors, such as SDOH, account for as much as 50 percent of a person’s health outcomes. When one or more of these conditions pose challenges, such conditions can become risk factors for poor health outcomes, as well as for inequitable health outcomes, particularly for Black, Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), and LGBTQ+ individuals, people who live in rural areas, and people with disabilities. The AMA supports CMS’s proposal to further incentivize screening for SDOH and referral to community support systems to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable inpatient, emergency department, and long-term care utilization. The AMA urges CMS to waive patient cost- sharing for CHI services, exclude these services from budget neutrality, expand the types of services that qualify as initiating visits, finalize the provision of these services under general supervision of a physician, and better define the services and personnel who can provide the service.\n",

            "\n",
            "The AMA has incorporated work to address SDOH, which is already being performed, and encouraged it through changes to coding and payment. As CMS notes, the CPT Editorial Panel recognized in the revised CPT E/M Guidelines that SDOH needs can increase the complexity of a physician’s medical decision-making for an E/M visit and increase risk to the patient, when diagnosis or treatment is significantly limited by SDOH. CMS adopted these guidelines, effective in 2021. For example, with use of E/M codes 99204 and 99205, which are used for moderate and high levels of medical decision-making (MDM) for a new patient, and 99214 and 99215 for established patients, SDOH factors may raise the risk of complications, morbidity, or mortality by limiting treatment options and diagnosis capability. We appreciate that CMS wishes to build on these efforts by establishing separate G-codes to promote Medicare beneficiary access to community-based social services (e.g., housing, utility, food assistance, and transportation) to address a patient’s health-related social needs (HRSN), the individual-level corollaries of community-level social determinants of health.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, to ensure that these services are accessible to the patients who need them the most, the AMA strongly urges CMS to explore all authorities, including working with the states and with Congress, to waive patient cost-sharing for these services. Under current policy, Medicare beneficiaries would be subject to a 20 percent co-insurance requirement to receive CHI services. Particularly for Medicare patients who are experiencing a HRSN, a majority of which are driven by financial hardship, out-of- pocket expenses can lead to delaying or foregoing these services. While research in this area is still growing and mixed for some interventions, there is promising evidence that well-designed and funded interventions lead to reduced health care utilization and costs. The Medicare program should reinvest these savings into waiving patient cost-sharing. Importantly, we believe CMS can also ensure greater access to these services by partnering with states to provide coverage of these services in their state Medicaid plans or coverage of cost-sharing for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Waiving patient cost-sharing would remove a significant barrier to uptake of care management services, including CHI.\n",

Unfortunately, patient cost-sharing is a barrier to care for other care management services that CMS has previously established as beneficiaries are not accustomed to out-of-pocket costs for this type of care. Obtaining patient consent will help ensure patients are aware of their cost-sharing responsibilities, and we believe providing this clarity to patients outweighs the additional burden imposed on physician practices to obtain informed consent.\n",

CMS believes there is a gap in the current care management code set for integration of community services provided by auxiliary personnel, including community health workers or peers. As this is a new service being provided by a new set of personnel who were not previously eligible to provide billable services under Medicare, we believe this falls outside the scope of budget neutrality as a change in law or regulation.\n",

            "At a minimum, the AMA urges CMS to maintain a low utilization assumption for these services.

We also urge CMS to expand the list of CHI initiating services beyond office/outpatient E/M services and the AWV.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like the Biden Administration, the AMA is committed to tackling the issues surrounding maternal mortality and morbidity. Providing postpartum insurance coverage is crucial as it ensures new mothers receive necessary medical care and support during a vulnerable period, promoting their physical and mental well-being. This coverage also facilitates early detection and management of potential complications, contributing to healthier outcomes for mothers and newborns. To this end, we believe postpartum community service integration will be an important use of these new services but requiring an E/M or AWV to initiate the service would create a barrier to access as those codes are bundled into the maternity care codes. While Medicare does not cover many births, it is an industry leader, and public and private plans regularly follow its determinations on coverage, coding, and payment. Therefore, we believe CMS should include the maternal care CPT codes, describing a bundle of services, on the list of CHI initiating visit codes.\n",

            "Fourth, we support CMS’s proposal to designate CHI services as care management services that may be furnished when the “incident to” billing requirements are met and under general supervision of the physician, which means the service is furnished under the physician’s overall direction and control, but the physician’s physical presence is not required. Critical to the success of CHI services will be the establishment of procedures to ensure direct communication between the community health worker and the patient’s medical team. We believe general supervision is the appropriate level of supervision to facilitate this communication.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fifth, the AMA urges CMS to clarify the difference between non-clinical CHI services and clinical care management services, as well as adopt CPT guidance on when it is appropriate to bill for both PIN and other care management services. We believe Principal Care Management (PCM) codes would be the appropriate service to report when community health integration is provided by a nurse, social worker, or other clinical staff. Further, we believe CMS’s proposal to allow a physician to bill separately for other care management services during the same month as CHI could lead to ambiguity and audit risk. To reduce these concerns, we urge CMS to adopt CPT guidance that “each minute of service time is counted toward only one service. Do not count any time and activities used to meet criteria for another reported service. However, time of clinical staff and time of a physician or other qualified health care professional are reported separately when each provides distinct services to the same patient at different times during the same calendar month.” Physicians and their coding professionals are already familiar with this CPT guidance, thus adopting it will reduce confusion and help ensure uniformity in billing guidelines.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, we urge CMS to better define the role of the auxiliary staff permitted to perform CHI services. To ensure patients understand the role of the community health worker (CHW) or other auxiliary staff providing CHI within the care team, we urge CMS to clarify that these staff should refrain from any activity that could be construed as clinical in nature, including interpreting test results or medical symptoms, offering second opinions, or making treatment recommendations. CHWs or peers should provide a supportive role for patients and, when necessary, help them understand medical information provided by physicians and other members of their medical care team. CHWs or peers should fully disclose relevant training, experience, and credentials, in order to help patients understand the scope of services the navigator is qualified to provide. They should also fully disclose potential conflicts of interest to those whom they service, including employment arrangements. As mentioned above, we believe CHI services provided by nurses, social workers or clinical staff would be more appropriately billed using the PCM codes.\n",

SDOH data could be considered as a pre-existing condition or become part of an evaluation of the patient record in other contexts (e.g., a life insurance application), where we do not yet fully know the possible impact of these social risks and needs, even if resolved. Patients should consent to being screened, understand the possible social risks that the given screener may detect (e.g., transportation insecurity, homelessness, victim of domestic abuse, etc.), and be aware that their screening results will appear in their medical record. A possible approach to mitigate potential negative implications might be to outsource screening and social care to organizations specializing in detecting social risks and offering referrals or interventions. With the consent of the patient, the minimum social care data required to improve the care of the patient could then be accessed by, or communicated to, the physician and documented in the patient’s medical records, if appropriate. Additionally, regulations should be considered to protect social risk and needs data outside of covered entities (e.g., community-based organizations). Regardless of how the data is collected, to protect patients from discrimination and other unintended consequences of collecting this data, consideration should be given to recording the minimum social care data required.\n",

However, research has shown that individuals with SDOH needs have a higher rate of ED visits.14 For this reason, screening can help physicians in these settings to formulate targeted interventions to facilitate referrals for patients (e.g., initiating primary care) with an unmet social need. In addition, expanding this service to the ED allows for the potential to reduce repeat ED use for patients by connecting them to navigation or community health integration services, improving their health outcomes and reducing costs to the Medicare program.\n",

Because CMS proposes that this service would be available to all Medicare beneficiaries, many patients will need only a standard screening tool to rule out any unmet social needs. This could be completed prior to the visit and free up time for physicians to do a deeper dive with those patients who are identified as having a HRSN that is unaddressed.

The AMA recognizes the importance of patient navigators to help improve access to care and to help patients with cancer and other high-risk, serious illnesses manage the complex aspects of the health care system.

Consideration should be given to including visits where there has been a substantial or sudden decline in medical (e.g., diabetes, cancer, end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease) or behavioral health (e.g., substance use disorder, serious mental illness) status or change in incarceration status.

One of the critical functions of a successful patient navigator program is to establish procedures to ensure direct communication between the navigator and the patient’s medical team. We believe general supervision is the appropriate level of supervision to facilitate this communication.\n",

Further, we believe CMS’s proposal to allow a physician to bill separately for other care management services during the same month as PIN could lead to ambiguity and audit risk. To reduce these concerns, we urge CMS to adopt CPT guidance that “each minute of service time is counted toward only one service. Do not count any time and activities used to meet criteria for another reported service. However, time of clinical staff and time of a physician or other qualified health care professional are reported separately when each provides distinct services to the same patient at different times during the same calendar month.” Physicians and their coding professionals are already familiar with this CPT guidance, thus adopting it will reduce confusion and help ensure uniformity in billing guidelines.\n",

For instance, ordering physicians must be able to easily identify the diagnoses and specific advanced diagnostic imaging services to which the AUC requirements apply so that they can consult the clinical decision support mechanism (CDSM) at the time of ordering. Ideally, they would be prompted to consult the CDSM upon ordering a service to which the requirements apply. Information regarding the CDSM consultation will then somehow need to be communicated between ordering and furnishing providers, as the physician ordering the imaging service in most cases will be different than the physician performing the imaging. Thus, not only must the claim change but also all methods used to send an order (electronically or otherwise).\n",

However, it remains unclear what would qualify as “an exchange of information.” The AMA urges CMS to release clarifying guidance expressly stating that in order to be covered by Medicare, any dental service must: 1) be ordered by the physician primarily responsible for managing that patient’s care for their Medicare-covered medical service; and 2) require follow-up by the dentist with the patient’s physician regarding outcomes of the relevant dental procedure. This ensures appropriate coordination with multiple members of patient care teams across settings which improves patient outcomes, helps to ensure the patient’s medical record remains appropriately updated, and helps to ensure that dental services are in fact contributing to improved outcomes for Medicare-covered clinical services as required.\n",

The COVID-19 PHE provided a forced natural experiment in which we learned that distance learning MDPP services are no less effective than those provided in-person. CMS explains: “to date, there have been no preliminary indications that the synchronous virtual delivery of MDPP has limited supplier instruction or beneficiary success.” In fact, “evaluation data confirm significantly increased weight loss accompanied with a higher number of sessions attended by participants completing the expanded model in 2021, with these participants attending primarily virtual sessions or a mixture of virtual and in-person sessions.” Distance learning service offerings actually improved program performance because beneficiaries were able to more easily access services.\n",

Accordingly, adding distance learning-only providers would directly result in expanding access to MDPP services for Medicare beneficiaries that live in more remote areas, have mobility issues, lack access to reliable transportation, or face other barriers to seeking in-person care. This has important health equity implications, which is a serious issue for the MDPP given that more than three quarters of the participants to date have been white females and that “MDPP supplier locations have traditionally clustered proximate to large metropolitan areas, leaving significant gaps throughout rural communities.”\n",

Importantly, there has also been a positive response to distance learning MDPP service offerings from beneficiaries. CMS states in the rule that “many beneficiaries have reported the desire to continue utilizing virtual delivery of MDPP for a wide range of reasons.” The fact is distance learning services are both effective and are in many cases even preferred by beneficiaries reaffirms that CMS should allow distance learning-only suppliers to participate in the program.

            "Clearly there is some sort of barrier preventing their participation in the MDPP. The AMA is aware that several would-be suppliers have repeatedly commented that the single largest barrier to their participation in the program is the stringent criteria that results from MDPP suppliers having to undergo screening for those considered a high-level risk for fraud, which requires Board members of organizations to submit to fingerprinting and submitting their social security numbers and other personally identifiable information. This can be a major barrier for non-clinical, community-based, often nonprofit organizations participating in the program. As noted earlier, the agency also already has several robust oversight mechanisms in place including regular monitoring by an independent third party. We strongly urge CMS to reclassify MDPP suppliers as medium fraud risk, which we believe will directly result in several reputable organizations with a national footprint reconsidering participating in the program as suppliers.

Nurse practitioners ordered more tests and formal consults than physicians and were more likely than physicians to seek information from external sources such as X-rays and CT scans.22 They also saw worse health outcomes, raising 30-day preventable hospitalizations by 20 percent, and increasing length of stay in the emergency department. Altogether, nurse practitioners practicing independently increased health care costs by $66 per emergency department visit.23 The study found that these productivity differences make nurse practitioners more costly than physicians to employ, even accounting for differences in salary.24 Not only does the increased resource use by nurse practitioners result in increased costs and longer lengths of stay, but it also means patients undergo unnecessary tests, procedures, and hospital admissions.\n",

            "In addition, a recent study from the Hattiesburg Clinic in Mississippi found that allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to function with independent patient panels in the primary care setting resulted in higher costs, higher utilization of services, and lower quality of care compared to panels of patients with a primary care physician.25 Specifically, the study found that non-nursing home Medicare ACO patient spend was $43 higher per member, per month for patients on a nurse practitioner/physician assistant panel compared to those with a primary care physician. Similarly, patients with a nurse practitioner/physician assistant as their primary care provider were 1.8 percent more likely to visit the ER and had an eight percent higher referral rate to specialists despite being younger and healthier than the cohort of patients in the primary care physician panel. On quality of care, the researchers examined 10 quality measures and found that physicians performed better on nine of the 10 measures compared to the nonphysicians.\n",

            "Additionally, multiple studies have shown that nurse practitioners order more diagnostic imaging than physicians, which increases health care costs and threatens patient safety by exposing patients to unnecessary radiation. For example, ordering x-rays increased substantially—more than 400 percent—by nonphysicians, primarily nurse practitioners and physician assistants, between 2003 and 2015.26 Furthermore, a Mayo Clinic study compared the quality of physician referrals for patients with complex medical problems against referrals from nurse practitioners and physician assistants for patients with the same problems. Physician referrals were better articulated, better documented, better evaluated, better managed, and were more likely to be evaluated as medically necessary than nurse practitioner or physician assistant referrals, which were more likely to be evaluated as having little clinical value.27 This sampling of studies clearly shows that nurse practitioners and physician assistants tend to misuse health\n",

The authors state that this type of care is often used as a step down for people who no longer need to be hospitalized but cannot be discharged safely, or as a step up for those who need more services and supports than can be provided in the office setting.

Hospitals also abstract clinical data on a sample of patients for the clinical process of care measures. None of these sample sizes, which are based on the number of plan participants or individuals admitted to the hospital for a specific diagnosis or procedure, come close to the current 70 percent data completeness requirement in MIPS and MSSP.

However, CMS is vague in terms of what will happen if it receives insufficient data. For example, what if only 10 ACOs report Medicare CQMs? There is a risk that some ACOs would then receive zero points and not have a quality score above zero. In addition, there is an even higher chance that they would only be able to achieve at most seven points since all but one of the MIPS CQMs/eCQM benchmarks are distributed across the 10 deciles.

One of the strengths of the set of quality measures within the Web- Interface is the inclusion of several measures related to preventive care, which incentivizes providers to deliver preventive care services to their patients. While it is expected that better preventive care will lead to better outcomes and therefore savings in the long term, it may lead to slight increases in spending in the short term if these high-value services were not previously being utilized. However, the current shared savings methodology does not account for this in any way and may actually penalize ACOs for short-term increases in spending for higher rates of preventive care services, despite this clearly being in the best interest of patients, as well as long-term savings for the Medicare program.

However, the PI data being collected from physicians also attempts to track EHR functionalities and usage that is largely out of the physician’s control. Physician-reported PI measures continue to be used as a proxy for actual EHR-EHR interoperability and patient access despite the fact that individual physicians have little to no control over how EHR systems are designed or whether patients are able to or choose to access their data. Furthermore, the MIPS data submission window does not open until the January following the performance year and does not close until April 1, and physicians are waiting up to 24 months or even longer to receive feedback on that data. Put simply, physician-reported PI data is often too out-of-date to inform policy changes or be leveraged to improve CEHRT usage practices for practices.\n",

Instead of extending MIPS PI requirements to QPs and Partial QPs participating in ACOs, CMS should look for opportunities to collaborate with other federal agency partners and leverage information that is already being collected, which would collect more useful data regarding adoption, use, and interoperability of CEHRT while reporting burden on physicians, therefore incentivizing them to join APMs.\n",

In previous public comments to CMS and ONC, the AMA expressed support for CMS’s goal of thinking creatively to reduce burden and promote interoperability and leverage vendor-provided health IT utilization data to simplify physician reporting and we outlined opportunities to specifically utilize ONC’s EHR Reporting Program as a supplemental data source for physician EHR data reporting.[4],[5] CMS officials have previously stated that PI numerator/denominator reporting by physicians is necessary to ensure they are using EHRs, providing patients with their electronic health information (EHI), reporting to public health agencies, and exchanging information, but we disagree. The AMA believes that the goals of reducing physician PI reporting burden and providing CMS and ONC insight into EHI access, exchange, or use can be jointly achieved by allowing physicians or ACOs to attest “yes/no” to meeting PI Objectives—rather than reporting a numerator/denominator—and supplementing that with automatically reported EHR developer-reported data.\n",

The proposed measure areas would use data derived from the certified health IT system itself and ONC would then generate metrics using numerator/denominator calculations based on the certified health IT’s supplied data points. Moreover, since ONC is proposing that EHR developers report their Insights Conditions data semiannually, ONC has an opportunity to provide CMS better, more timely data about real-world CEHRT adoption and use. In the HTI-1 Proposed Regulation, ONC itself discusses how the Insights Conditions measure has the potential to improve informing and monitoring the implementation of key ONC policies, assess the impacts of these various efforts, and understand their uptake and use for future development and improvements.\n",

This proposed policy represents a substantive change from previous CEHRT requirements that would require a significant lift from ACOs, participating clinicians and practices, and vendors that would be extremely difficult to implement within that timeframe. Furthermore, because CMS releases QP and Partial QP determination information throughout the performance period, including as late as March of the year following the performance period, the timing would mean that some ACOs would have to meet the PI reporting requirements despite being QPs or partial QPs – and therefore excluded from MIPS under law – simply because they would not be aware of their QP status by the last date to begin collecting PI data.

CMS notes in the rule that their proposal to add a new third attribution step with an expanded assignment window of 24 months would result in slightly increased populations of both assigned and assignable beneficiary populations, and would therefore have downstream impacts on minimum savings rates, performance payment limits, and high/low revenue status, etc. However, it is unclear to us based on the information and analysis provided in the rule whether there could be any potential adverse unintended consequences, particularly on specific types of ACOs and patient subpopulations. CMS’s observation that the newly captured patients have lower service utilization and higher mortality rates, suggests for example that this new patient population may be disproportionately patients who do not frequently engage with primary care physicians or who may be experiencing potential barriers to access and likely captured as a result of receiving follow-up care to an acute event. We request a more detailed breakdown of CMS’s modeling showing how this policy would affect different types of ACOs, such as rural ACOs, smaller ACOs with smaller patient populations, and those treating large safety net populations. Furthermore, CMS provides modeling based on 2021 data, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic. While the AMA supports the spirit of the proposal to enhance attribution, we feel more detailed information, including modeling based on additional years of data, as well as a breakdown of any disparate impacts by ACO type and patient sub-populations, is necessary so consequences can be more fully evaluated and interested parties can provide more informed feedback before such a policy is finalized.\n",

Details on PASC and how it could be used to improve the success of ACOs and other population-based payment models are included in the May 5, 2023 letter to the Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) that we sent in response to PTAC’s request for input on this issue.

In fact, we strongly believe the Quality Payment Program would work more successfully if the opposite were true – if APM measures and data and flexibilities were better incorporated into MIPS as a way to begin preparing physicians to participate in an APM if and when the opportunity arises.

The AMA first highlighted the policy disconnect in our 2017 MFS Interim Final Rule comments and have since repeatedly highlighted our concerns with the MIPS benchmarking methodology during the yearly MFS comment period. CMS has operated Care Compare in a silo and often proposes and finalizes methodological changes through sub-regulatory comment and webinars. Therefore, there are now multiple programs by which CMS attempts to rank and compare the quality-of-care physicians provide. MIPS involves awarding points to physicians based on where they fall in decile-based categories calculated from historical quality measure data (when available). Notably, this methodology differs from CMS’s Care Compare star rating public reporting program. Care Compare uses the Achievable Benchmarks of Care (ABC) methodology to place physicians into one of five categories (each with a corresponding “star rating”) for purposes of helping patients compare physicians to make more informed decisions about where they seek care. In contrast, the MIPS methodology uses nine categories (and point system) to score physicians on quality measure reporting to determine whether a physician will be subject to a MIPS penalty or eligible for an incentive. As a result, through our examination, the two methodologies (MIPS and 5-star) result in inconsistent ratings and comparisons.\n",

It will be less burdensome to implement this model that is verified by a registry or certification program, for example, than it is to measure a series of metrics tied to a clinical visit but not necessarily linked to improvement efforts. The intent is to have physicians and the care team focused on delivering optimal care over the lifecycle of a condition, procedure, or other health care need rather than solely focusing on meeting a payer’s metric(s) during each visit. Our recommendation would also promote the use of innovative technologies by practices such as leveraging digitally enhanced data and interoperability to support their improvement cycles, inform near-real time decision-making and co-management, and to inform and engage patients. Practices would be incentivized to take steps to expand their digital capabilities beyond CEHRT functionalities and improvement activities are built into the overall model design and therefore would not require any additional documentation or reporting. The re-envisioned model, by its very nature, would use CEHRT as the foundation but promote the use of broader digital health tools to coordinate care, leverage knowledge to inform clinical decisions, engage patients where they are at, and address health disparities. It is no longer necessary or appropriate to require the use of specific technology; physicians’ use of CEHRT is well above critical mass and incentives must focus on reducing burden and simplifying reporting.

Rather, CMS should be intentional about the MVPs that it creates and should develop them around conditions, episodes of care, and clinical priority areas that have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable costs for a broad range of Medicare beneficiaries.

            "Most finalized and proposed MVPs repeat many of the same problems as traditional MIPS—notably a lack of clinical relevance to physicians and the way they practice, as well as individualized patient needs. For instance, orthopaedic and neurosurgeons who specialize in spine surgery appear to fall under the Musculoskeletal Care and Rehabilitative Support MVP, but the functional status measures capture rehab/therapy/chiropractic services and not surgery. Therefore, the MVP has little to no relevancy for surgeons or patients for deciphering physician outcomes when deciding to have spine surgery. By contrast, CMS established the Improving Care for Lower Extremity Joint Repair MVP, which includes quality and cost measures that evaluate care for patients needing lower extremity surgical repair, such as fractures and total joint replacements. Unlike a broad MVP that would include orthopaedic surgeries from multiple, significantly different anatomic regions, this MVP has the potential to provide physicians with actionable performance feedback about patient outcomes and avoidable costs, as well as useful information to patients who may be able to shop around for this surgery. With this MVP as a precedent, CMS should work with national medical specialty societies to develop MVPs around targeted episodes of care or conditions and with appropriate measures, rather than developing MVPs at the broad specialty level and simply repackaging problematic measures.

The intention of the MVP is muddied by including measures across these distinct populations without consideration of how these two populations are treated differently in practice. A refined MVP more focused on gynecology and women’s health prevention and wellness with a separate MVP focused on maternity care is more in line with these guiding principles and the intent of MVPs as expressed by CMS, as well as the Administration’s goals on improving maternal health.

Furthermore, any MVPs aimed at chronic conditions should promote investing in preventive services as a critical element of the transformation to value-based care. However, including TPCC could unfairly penalize physicians for successfully improving the utilization of recommended preventive services due to the way total costs are measured in the same year as services provided.

We continue to support CMS’s policy of applying the higher of the scores for individual clinicians based on traditional MIPS or MVPs, and we believe that CMS should similarly apply the group’s facility-based score to the subgroup score, if applicable.

According to a 2021 study published in JAMA, compliance with MIPS costs $12,811 per physician per year. In addition, physicians spend 53 hours per year on MIPS-related tasks which is equivalent to a full week of patient visits.

The analysis also found that the disparity between smaller and larger practices was larger for family physicians than other specialists. The average score for a small family practice small practices was 71.1 compared to 89.9 overall.

The program has been operating with a failsafe under the EUC hardship exception since 2019 due to the COVID-19 PHE, and the 2017 and 2018 performance years were markedly different from the current program—the requirements to comply are more strict, 25 cost measures now account for 30 percent of the final score, and many bonus points have been retired.\n",

In fact, most physician practices are only just now seeing any performance feedback in the cost category based on the 2022 performance period, and it is likely that there are many who applied for reweighting of the cost category due to the impact of the pandemic.

However, we do not believe that vendors truly understand what is intended with data completeness and therefore the percentage received by CMS does not accurately capture the eligible population for each TIN. Some physicians and almost all ACOs provide services across multiple sites using the same National Provider Identifier or TIN combination, but not all sites (including across sites of service) may participate in MIPS, the registry, or EHR that the physician opts to use for MIPS reporting.

            "It is only with the release of the 2022 cost measure benchmarks that it became apparent to the AMA that the revised TPCC measure is using a monthly, or four-week, benchmark period evaluating cost performance. We have questions and concerns about this approach that we feel were not properly vetted during the reevaluation and review period because this change was not readily apparent to interested parties, including the members of the technical expert panel, as well as measure endorsers. We believe that this change to a monthly reporting period compromises the validity of this measure. For example, we do not believe CMS has adequately tested a monthly risk adjustment methodology, nor do we believe that a monthly cost assessment meets face validity. Therefore, we request CMS examine the impact of this shift on the overall variation of the costs and consider to what extent are those differences due to scenarios such as a new vs. established patient in the practice or seasonality of patient visits (e.g., snowbirds)? In addition, services and related spending for certain chronic conditions are likely distributed over several months, or longer, while service utilization and spending for acute conditions will be concentrated in one month. Are physicians who see patients with multiple chronic conditions fairly and accurately measured against physicians who see patients for acute conditions and vice versa? Further, we are concerned that a physician who is attributed six months of care could be disadvantaged compared to a physician who is able to spread the cost of care across all twelve months.\n",

There are no quality measures reported by monthly rates since they would not be clinically meaningful, so while there might have been some use to an annual TPCC measure, we believe that this revised monthly TPCC measure has lost any relevance or ability to be aligned to quality. For a diabetes patient, what does one month of total per capita cost tell us? Does CMS plan to develop and require reporting monthly quality measures? How does CMS currently represent and explain the difference in reporting periods for quality vs cost to physicians?\n",

The revised measure could cause primary care physicians to refuse to do pre-surgical clearance visits on new patients in order to avoiding having the surgery patients appear on his or her attribution list.\n",

            "\tIf a new patient comes to see a primary care physician, and the patient has multiple chronic conditions or health problems, the revised measure will give the physician an undesirable disincentive to schedule follow up visits within three months, so the patient and their costs are not attributed to the physician.\n",

            "\tOn the other hand, new patients who are healthy or whose health problems are appropriately managed and who do not need to come back to see the primary care physician for six months or one year would not be attributed to that physician. The low costs would not be reflected in the primary care physician’s TPCC average, making it appear higher than reality. In that case, the primary care physician would need to order an EKG or other test simply to trigger attribution.\n",

            "Another significant problem with the revised methodology is that it does not identify the end of a clinician’s primary care responsibility for a patient. TPCC assigns responsibility for all Medicare Part A and B costs for 12 months after attribution. However, because CMS is aware that Medicare beneficiaries switch physicians or move to new states, the revised measure adopted a workaround that attributes the same patients and overlapping costs to multiple clinicians in different practices if they meet the attribution criteria. To illustrate the problems with this change, under the previous measure, when a patient switches to a new primary care physician, the patient’s new doctor may be held responsible for things that happened before he or she took over, but once the patient starts seeing a different doctor, the patient will be attributed to the new doctor. Under the revised measure, both physicians will be held responsible for services and procedures that happen after the patient switches to another physician. In another example, a beneficiary travels to a different city, experiences a health problem and visits a new primary care physician, who runs a laboratory test and determines the beneficiary is fine. The beneficiary returns home, but the new physician is now responsible for all spending for this beneficiary for the next year, even though the beneficiary does not even live in the community.\n",

We have concerns about the impact of spreading accountability so widely, which CMS believes will improve care coordination. Yet this assumes data regarding services provided by other physicians is readily available and therefore actionable by the attributed physician. CMS does not provide this information, and it would be next to impossible to track patients and make value-enhancing changes in their care because the revised attribution methodology relies on a lengthy list of services, including services provided by a separate physician practice.

Therefore, a practice comprised of excluded specialists might still be subject to the measure if it also uses a physician assistant or nurse practitioner who provides an E/M visit and another primary care service. This will make it hard to determine which practices are likely to be subject to the TPCC measure. It also creates a fairness issue by excluding certain specialties regarded as not providing primary care, but it then holds primary care physicians responsible for the costs of these non-primary-care services that they do not provide and cannot control.\n",

Now that the Cost Performance Category comprises 30 percent of the final score, oncologists may face up to a four-fold increase in magnitude of penalties. We are concerned that neither the TPCC nor the MSPB Clinician measures fully account for the variation in costs in the standard-of-care medicine by specialty and urge CMS and Acumen, LLC, to consider whether specialty-specific recalibration is needed to prevent disparate payment penalties by specialty.

This category has faced the most significant disruptions due to the pandemic and physicians have little information about how they are performing on cost measures, which unlike most other MIPS measures and activities, are calculated by CMS on the backend using claims data. It may therefore not be feasible for many physicians to see any year-to-year comparisons in their cost performance data for several more years. However, we do believe that the improvement scoring should increase as the maturity of this category continues. Improvement scoring is an important component of many APMs, and we believe that MIPS should also reward improvement, as well as annual performance. However, there are many advantages to participation in APMs that do not exist in MIPS, such as incentive payments and waivers, so we believe that improvement scoring should only ever be added to performance scoring and not a separate benchmark.\n",

We believe this would be consistent with the formula used for quality improvement scoring, which will further reduce confusion. This is also consistent with CMS’s “description of previously finalized cost improvement scoring methodology,” which provides: “we established that we would quantify the cost improvement score by subtracting the number of cost measures with a significant decline from the number of cost measures with a significant improvement, and then dividing the result by the number of cost measures for which the MIPS eligible clinician or group was scored for two consecutive performance periods, and then multiply the resulting fraction by the maximum improvement score” (emphasis added).\n",

We are glad to see CMS recognize our concerns in the 2024 MFS Proposed Rule and propose to expand the available data to include Medicare Advantage.

            "CMS is seeking comments regarding ways to publicly report cost performance information on clinician and group profile pages beginning with data from the 2024 performance period, which would be publicly reported in 2026. Twenty-five cost measures could be available for public reporting – 23 episode-based cost measures (EBCMs), Total Per Capita Cost (TPCC), and Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) clinician measure. Among other things, CMS is interested in feedback about potential approaches to reporting MIPS cost measures, including whether it is more meaningful to only report aggregated episodes or include component-level cost information for the EBCMs and benchmarking and possible comparators, as well as how to best present this information to provide frames of reference for the cost performance information. For example, while higher than expected costs may be driven by adverse outcomes, overall cost is comprised of care components that consumers could perceive as higher quality (e.g., follow-up visits) as well as lower quality (e.g., re-hospitalizations).\n",
            "\n",
            "Before we address CMS’s specific questions, we wish to note the difficulty of providing CMS with detailed feedback about how best to publicly report cost measures as CMS itself has provided very little information about the current cost measures. The cost performance category is unique in that all the data is calculated on the back end by CMS using claims; nothing is reported by eligible clinicians. This means that physicians are reliant on CMS to share timely, actionable information about their performance. Yet, no cost measure information has been made available since the 2019 performance period due to reweighting the cost performance category to zero percent of the final score in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 PHE. Since then, 15 new EBCMs and the revised TPCC and MSPB measures have entered the program. Yet we do not have a sense of the drivers of high and poor performance on those measures.\n",

The only information that CMS made available is about how the cost measures were calculated, but this is superfluous as all cost measures are calculated using claims data. We do not know how many eligible clinicians or groups were scored on the cost measures, how many patients were attributed to each clinician or group, how far the scores deviated from the mean or median, whether performance largely hovered around the mean or was spread across the 10 deciles, and so on.\n",

As detailed earlier in this letter, the AMA has significant concerns with this measure and does not believe it should be used in the program. Notably, the TPCC measure is now using a monthly benchmark, which we believe removes any ability to align with quality measures, which use an annual or longer benchmark. In addition, a recent study52 published in JCO Oncology Practice found that oncologists scored poorly on cost measures compared with other specialties in 2018. We are concerned that TPCC does not fully account for the variation in costs in the standard-of-care medicine by specialty.\n",

            "Second, we firmly believe CMS should only publicly report cost measures that have at least one companion quality measure to contextualize the information for patients and their caregivers. The agency believes it cannot support a display of cost alongside quality measures because physicians may report quality measures that are clinically unrelated to the clinician’s cost measures and because group- reported quality measures cannot be disaggregated to the clinician level. Rather than use these limitations as an excuse for not publicly reporting cost information alongside quality information for patients, we urge CMS to amend its approach so that only cost measures with a companion quality measure are reported. We believe it is preferable to see fewer individual clinicians with publicly reported cost measures at the outset than risk the confusion it would cause patients to see cost measure information outside of the context of accompanying quality information. CMS itself states that patients often misinterpret higher cost information as meaning higher overall quality of care. The agency should not perpetuate this misconception by providing cost information absent quality measures.\n",

Notably, this methodology differs from CMS’s Care Compare star rating public reporting program. Care Compare uses the Achievable Benchmarks of Care (ABC) methodology to place physicians into one of five categories (each with a corresponding “star rating”) for purposes of helping patients compare physicians to make more informed decisions about where they seek care. In contrast, the MIPS methodology uses nine categories (and point system) to score physicians on quality measure reporting to determine whether a physician will be subject to a MIPS penalty or eligible for an incentive.

The AMA recognizes that CMS does not have the authority to extend the incentive payments as they were established by Congress when it passed MACRA in 2015. The AMA supports the bipartisan Value in Health Care Act (HR 5013), which has been reintroduced in the 118th Congress and would reinstate the full five-percent Advanced APM incentive payment and extend it for an additional two years. This is critical to continuing to incentivize APM adoption with still fewer than 20 percent of traditional Medicare payments flowing through APMs that qualify as Advanced APMs as of 2022. APM incentive payments often represent the only way for practices to be compensated for high-value services not supported by the traditional MFS, including working with community-based organizations to overcome barriers to care for underserved patient populations, and are an important way to offset up-front investments in new technologies or staffing, as well as revenue losses resulting from new service delivery efficiencies that can be difficult for practices to weather, particularly in the initial years of model implementation when retrospective performance payments have yet to be paid.\n",

            "The AMA strongly supports CMS’s intended goal behind making QP calculations at the individual clinician level, rather than APM entity level, in that it would mitigate possible incentives for APM Entities to exclude specialists from participation lists, and thereby increase specialty participation in APMs, and we appreciate the agency being responsive to the feedback previously received on this issue. At the same time, the effects of this proposal have not been included in the rule and we have some concern that there could be unforeseen and disparate impacts across certain types of practices and patient sub-populations, including rural settings, and historically minoritized and other underserved populations. It also is not clear that the policy change would lead to more specialist engagement or participation in APMs. There is no breakdown in the impact analysis, for example, of how many physicians in various specialties would be expected to achieve QP status under each methodology. While the proposed new methodology may address perverse incentives from the APM Entity perspective to keep specialists off participation lists as CMS asserts, calculating QP determinations at an individual level could have the same effect if individual specialists are dissuaded from seeking to participate in APMs because the QP threshold appears beyond reasonable reach. This is another reason why CMS should apply a separate QP threshold for specialists in APMs if afforded additional flexibilities by Congress, as noted above.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, as CMS notes in the rule, it is natural to expect a larger relative proportion of primary care- based services to flow through APMs, particularly for models with assignment methodologies based on primary care codes. This in no way means that the non-primary care specialists who participate in those models are any less engaged or committed to the central value-based mission of the APM. In fact, patients whose care is effectively managed by a primary care physician-led team may require fewer specialty referrals if their conditions are well controlled. The fact that patients are being effectively managed and seeing specialists only when necessary is an indicator that the APM is functioning exactly as it should, not the opposite. Non-primary care specialists should not be punished for this due to a one-size-fits all calculation that fails to recognize that patients attributed to a high-functioning APM may be receiving the right mix of primary care and other specialist services. Furthermore, because specialists often tend to receive patients from a broad range of referral sources, current rules that limit certain non-primary care specialists to participation in one ACO or APM Entity can make it even more difficult for individual specialty physicians to reach QP thresholds. In addition to the other proposals in this section, we would encourage CMS to revisit this existing policy and consider allowing specialists to participate in multiple ACOs/APM Entities.\n",

Under PASC, a specialist would receive an enhanced payment for delivering specific types of services to patients who are referred by primary care physicians participating in the ACO. Agreements between specialists and ACOs would describe how the specialist would use these enhanced payments to improve outcomes and/or reduce avoidable spending. Health equity would also be improved by providing higher payments to help support care for patients who have complex conditions or who are at higher risk for poor outcomes due to health-related social needs or other factors. In our May 2023 letter to the Physician- Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC), we outline specifically how the PASC can be used to more effectively integrate specialty care into population-based models.\n",

We were encouraged by the agency’s separate request for information on episode payment models, which the AMA responded to. In our comments, we highlight the importance of designing voluntary models that have prospective payment models that allow physician participants to make needed investments in practice transformation and to deliver the services their patients need, so that physicians would know how much they would be paid before they deliver care to a patient, and they would receive that payment promptly following the delivery of services. We also discuss the importance of soliciting input from physicians earlier in the development process, providing models with a sufficient runway to generate results, designing metrics at the appropriate level so that physicians are held accountable for what they can truly control, providing regular performance feedback (more than annually), and rewarding improved patient outcomes and quality of care, not only financial performance.

If Congress had wanted this CEHRT criterion to apply to each individual APM participant or a specific percentage of them, it would have expressly defined this as it did with other thresholds in the rule, including the Qualifying APM Participant threshold. Congress did not impose a threshold of 100 percent and we believe CMS is exceeding its statutory authority.\n",

ONC data can serve as a means to determine CEHRT adoption and use without burdening Advanced APM Participants with unnecessary and an unforgiving reporting requirement to meet a certain threshold of adoption.\n",

ONC intends for these metrics to help EHR users, federal entities, and the health IT industry better evaluate certified EHR functionality without overburdening providers to report duplicate information.

This probably applies to any original text <6 sentences in length. Generally, we wouldn't spend much time trying to paraphrase such short comment text.\n",
        "3.\tThe overall question to consider for the medium and long comments: Is it better to have something there for the reviewers to work with, even if not the right sentences were copied by the AI, than to have no pre-populated draft summaries for the reviewers to start with? This will be answered by how well your summaries capture the key aspects of the original text.\"\"\"\n",
        "#text=\"Continuation   of   Non-Facility   Payment  Rate CMS proposes that telehealth services provided to patients in their homes should be reported with place   of service (POS) code 10, which was established in the 2022 final rule. CMS established policy in the 2023 final rule that,   for calendar year 2023,   Medicare would continue paying for telehealth   services at the non-facility payment rate instead of returning to its pre-PHE policy of paying for these services at the reduced facility payment rates that apply to services provided in hospital settings. (Although the facility rates are lower than the non-facility rates, for services provided in hospitals and other facility settings, Medicare   makes   a   separate   payment   to   the   facility   in   addition   to   the   payment for the   physician   service.) In the current rule, CMS proposes to align with the telehealth-related flexibilities that were extended via the CAA, 2023, by continuing to pay for telehealth services provided to patients in their homes at the non- facility payment rate for 2024 when the services are reported with POS 10. The AMA appreciates CMS’s recognition that physicians who provide both in-person office services and telehealth services need to receive sufficient compensation to cover the expense of maintaining their medical office.\"\n",

            "Error processing text 1: : To   ensure   Medicare   patients   maintain   or   improve   their   access   to   care   and   to   preserve   the   financial viability of physician practices, CMS should use every policy lever available to reduce the proposed 2024 physician payment cut. The   2024   Medicare   conversion   factor   is   proposed   to   be   reduced   by   3.36   percent   from   $33.8872   to $32.7476.   Similarly,   the   anesthesia   conversion   factor   is   proposed   to   be   reduced   from   $21.1249   to $20.4370. These cuts result from a -1.25 percent reduction in the temporary update to the conversion factor under current law and a negative budget neutrality adjustment stemming in large part from the adoption   of   an   office   visit   add-on   code,   discussed   below.   Unfortunately,   these   cuts   coincide   with   ongoing growth in the cost to practice medicine as CMS projects the increase in the MEI for 2024 will be 4.5  percent. Physician practices cannot continue to absorb increasing costs while their payment rates dwindle. We already know how that story ends, and it is not a happy ending. According to the  , if physician   payment   does   not   change,   access   to   Medicare-participating   physicians   will   become   a   significant issue in the long term. Some Medicare patients are already experiencing inequitable delays in care, and   we know that when care is delayed, health outcomes worsen. These problems particularly impact minoritized and marginalized patients  and those who live in rural areas.  Will patients with Medicare have to wait six months to see a neurologist when they can no longer remember what day of the week it is? Will they have to wait eight months for an appointment with an oncologist about a persistent lump? Will they forego an endoscopy or mammography because the nearest gastroenterologist or radiologist who   accepts   Medicare   is   more   than   an   hour   away?   We   are   urging   both   Congress   and   CMS   to   intervene before these problems get any worse. We appreciate that in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress partially mitigated a 4.5 percent cut to Medicare physician payment rates, but physicians still endured a two percent pay cut this year   and   for   2024,   physicians   are   facing   another   1.25   percent   cut,   once   again   confronting   the   grim   task   of reconciling how to keep their lights on while getting paid less, while their expenses continue to rise. In fact, between 2001 and 2023, the cost of running a medical practice increased 47 percent, or 1.8 percent per year. In striking contrast, physician payment rates have    just nine percent over the last 22 years, or 0.4 percent per year, according to data from the Medicare Trustees. Adjusted for inflation, Medicare physician payment rates declined 26 percent from 2001 to 2023, or by 1.3 percent per year. Hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and nearly every other Medicare provider receive an annual update. Physicians compete in the same marketplaces as these providers for clinical and administrative staff, equipment, and supplies. Yet physicians are at a significant disadvantage due to payment cuts and because   their   payments   have   failed   to   keep   up   with   inflation.   It   is   no   wonder   that   these   trends   are   driving consolidation, which is highly likely to increase future Medicare costs as these other providers receive increasingly higher payments than the diminishing number of independent medical practices. This Administration has    that   health   care consolidation   is   leaving   many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive health care options. A new AMA analysis shows that by far, the most cited reason that independent physicians sell their practices   to   hospitals   or   health   systems   had   to   do   with   inadequate   payment.   Next   were   the   need   to   better manage payers’ regulatory and administrative requirements and the need to improve access to costly resources. Included below is an excerpted figure with more detail. The AMA strongly supports policies that promote market competition and patient choice. Payment adequacy is necessary for physicians to continue to have the ability to practice independently.  1   See e.g.,  Johnston KJ, Hammond G, Meyers DJ, Joynt Maddox KE. Association of Race and Ethnicity and Medicare   Program   Type   With   Ambulatory   Care   Access   and   Quality   Measures.   JAMA.   2021;326(7):628–636.  doi:10.1001/jama.2021.10413 2    Earlier this year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission ( MedPAC ) recommended that Congress increase   2024   Medicare   physician   payments   above   current   law   by   linking   the   payment update   to   the   MEI, something the AMA and organized medicine have long    MedPAC  raised concerns about the growing gap between what it costs to run a medical practice and what Medicare pays.  While we recognize that CMS does not have the authority to provide an inflation-based update for physicians, we strongly urge the agency to use every policy lever available to reduce the proposed budget neutrality reduction for physician services in 2024 and to close the gap between the Medicare physician payment update and the rising cost of practicing medicine, which is estimated to increase by 4.5 percent next year. As discussed below, we believe CMS should lower the utilization estimate for the office visit add-on code, which would lower the budget neutrality cut to the conversion factor. The   AMA   and   organized   medicine   are   also   pursuing   legislative   relief   from   the   unsustainable   trajectory   of Medicare physician payment. Specifically, we    H.R. 2474, the “Strengthening Medicare for Patients and Providers Act,” which provides a permanent annual update equal to the increase in the MEI. Such an update would allow physicians to invest in their practices and implement new strategies to provide high-value, patient-centered care.   We hope the agency   will work with the   AMA and Congress to seek   this   legislative   relief.   This   would   enable   CMS   to   prioritize   advancing   high-quality   care   for Medicare beneficiaries without the constant specter of market consolidation or inadequate access to care. These concerns stem from the disparity between Medicare physician payment rates and the actual costs associated with delivering high-quality care.  Determination   of\n",

            "Error processing text 2: Practice   Expense   (PE)   Relative   Value   Units   (RVUs)  Recommendation: The AMA strongly supports the CMS proposal to postpone implementation of new MEI relative value   weights.   The   AMA   is   engaged   in   a   significant effort   to   collect practice   costs   data   and   urges CMS to continue to base MEI weights on AMA data sources. MEI   and   the   Physician   Practice   Information   (PPI)  Survey The MEI, first implemented in 1975, has long served as a measure of practice cost inflation and a mechanism   to   determine   the   proportion   of   payments   attributed   to   physician   earnings   and   practice   costs.   In the nearly 50 years since the initial establishment of the MEI, data collected by the AMA has served as   the standard and a consistent source of information about physicians’ earnings and practice costs. The MEI weights that are the basis for current CMS   rate setting were based on data obtained   from the AMA’s PPI Survey. This survey was last conducted in 2007/2008 and collected 2006 data. In last year’s Final Rule, CMS finalized updated MEI weights for the different cost components of the MEI   for CY   2023   using   a   new   methodology   based   primarily   on   a   subset   of data   from   the   2017   US   Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS). However, CMS also noted that they postponed implementation   of   the   proposed   MEI   changes   until   time   uncertain,   referencing   the   need   for   continued   public   comment   due to the significant impact to physician payments. MEI  History In the CY 2024 Proposed Rule, CMS announced that they will continue to postpone implementation of the updated MEI weights, referencing the AMA’s national study to collect representative data on physician   practice   expenses,   the   AMA   PPI   Survey.   The   AMA   applauds   CMS   for   recognizing   the   PPI Survey effort and postponing implementation of the updated MEI relative value weights. “In light of the AMA’s intended data   collection efforts   in the near   future   and because the methodological and data source changes to the MEI finalized in the CY 2023 PFS Final Rule would have significant impacts   on   PFS   payments,   we   continue   to   believe   that   delaying   the   implementation   of the   finalized   2017- based MEI cost weights for the RVUs is consistent with our efforts to balance payment stability and predictability   with   incorporating   new   data   through   more   routine   updates.   Therefore,   we   are   not   proposing to incorporate the 2017-based MEI in PFS [rate setting] for CY 2024.” The AMA and Mathematica formally launched the PPI Survey on July 31, 2023.   supported   by     will   provide   more   than   10,000   physician   practices   with   the opportunity   to   share   their   practice   cost   data   and   number   of   direct   patient   care   hours   provided   by   both physicians and qualified health care professionals. A   coalition   of   other   non-MD/DO   organizations   is   also   working   with   Mathematica   to   administer   a   similar study of their respective professions. These physician and qualified health care professional (QHP) surveys will be in the field through April 2024. Data would be shared with CMS in early 2025 for the 2026 MFS rulemaking process. Major   Flaw   with   Updated   MEI   Weight   Methodology CMS   used   data from the US   Census Bureau’s Service   Annual Survey   (SAS)   as   the primary   source   for   the proposed   MEI   cost-component   weights.   The   changes   lead   to   substantial   increases   in   the   weights   for   many of the key components of physician practice expense and would greatly reduce the MEI weights for physician work and professional liability insurance. If   the   implementation   of   the   MEI   weights   is   budget   neutral,   overall   physician   work   payment   would   be   cut by 7 percent and practice liability insurance (PLI) payment would be reduced severalfold. The weight of non-physician   compensation   would   increase   from 16.6   percent   to   24.7   percent under the   new   MEI.   These large shifts are principally due to a substantial error in CMS analysis, which omitted nearly 200,000 facility-based   physicians.   After   correcting   for   this   major   omission,   the   physician   work   MEI   weight   would instead increase and PLI would likely experience a much smaller reduction. CMS relied on US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)   data   to   split   out   the   US   Census   SAS   data   using   only   the   “Offices   of   Physicians”   North   American Industry Classification System (NAICS) category 6211. However, only 64 percent of employed physicians are in this category. CMS-updated MEI erroneously excluded 36 percent of physicians who   are employed in other health care settings, such as hospitals. For example, the “General Medical and Surgical Hospitals” category (NAICS 6221) was not included in the CMS analysis and this category includes 158,880 employed physicians according to the 2017 BLS OEWS data. In the CY2023   MFS Final   Rule,   in responses   to   the AMA and RUC pointing out   this omission of data in the CMS analysis, CMS responded that “for physicians who are employed in other health care settings directly, such as hospitals, we do not believe that including costs for physicians that do not incur any operating expenses associated with running a practice would be technically appropriate.” However, this fails to consider that the MEI weights also cover physician compensation and professional liability insurance.   By   excluding   NAICS   6221   General   Medical   and   Surgical   Hospitals   in   the   CMS   MEI   weights analysis, CMS inadvertently omitted over $30 billion in physician compensation and over $7 billion in professional liability insurance compensation. Also, physician practices do still have some indirect practice   expense   costs   even   for providers   who   are   solely   facility-based   (coding,   billing,   scheduling,   etc.). The CMS   analysis of   the   US   Census SAS   data captured a large   majority of practice expense   covered by the   MFS   but   only   a   subset   of   the   physician   compensation   and   professional   liability   insurance   premiums. For facility-based services, the MFS includes the payment for physician work, professional liability insurance, and the practice expense associated with the physician (e.g., billing costs) only. A separate facility payment (e.g., Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), Ambulatory Surgical Center) covers the cost of the service when performed in that setting. With the omission of over $30 billion in physician compensation and over $7 billion in professional liability insurance premiums for most   facility-based   physicians,   the   CMS-updated   MEI   greatly   underrepresented   the   actual   proportion   of work and PLI costs that practices incur when performing services paid for by the MFS.  The AMA strongly   urges   CMS   to   correct   the   substantial   error   in   their   updated   MEI   weights   and   to   postpone implementation of the updated MEI weights until after the AMA completes its national study to collect representative data on physician practice expenses.

            "Error processing text 3: Comment   on   Strategies   for   Updates   to   Practice   Expense   Data   Collection   Methodology In   the   Proposed   Rule,   CMS   included   five   questions   related   to   the   AMA   PPI   Survey: If CMS should consider aggregating data for certain physician specialties to generate indirect allocators so that PE/HR calculations based on PPI survey data would be less likely to over- allocate   (or   under-allocate)   indirect   PE   to   a   given   set   of   services,   specialties,   or   practice   types. Further, what thresholds or methodological approaches could be employed to establish such  aggregations? The AMA PPI survey uses stratification to control the distribution of sampled cases, either to match the distribution of the population or to differ from it in a controlled way. The use of stratification will   improve the precision of estimates, both overall and within subgroups defined by the stratification. The AMA   recommends   that   CMS   postpone   any   consideration   of   the   level   of   granularity   of   specialty-level   data until after the PPI demonstrates the differences and similarities of practice costs by specialty. The AMA and Mathematica could consider recommendations related to this question once the study is completed. Whether   aggregations   of   services,   for   purposes   of   assigning   PE   inputs,   represent   a   fair,   stable, and accurate means to account for indirect PE across various specialties or practice types? The AMA believes that it is important for the CMS practice expense methodology to have a sufficient level   of   granularity   to   reflect   actual   practice   costs   incurred   by   physician   practices.   Ambulatory   payment classification   (APC) codes   from the OPPS, for example, would   not   represent   a fair, stable, and accurate means to account for indirect practice expense for the MFS due to lack of granularity. Resource costs in the MFS are developed through an extremely granular “bottom-up” methodology in which the necessary resource costs are added line-by-line to achieve the actual costs for the physician to provide   the   care.   In   contrast,   payment   to   facilities   under   the   OPPS   is   calculated   on   the   geometric   mean   of the costs of services in the same APC codes. To equate the rigorously developed line-item costs associated with services performed in the non-facility setting, with charges that are intended to be an average of “similar” services when performed in the facility is severely flawed because the two systems are making payments under vastly different assumptions. While hospital charge information is updated on a rolling basis, it does not mean that these cost data are more accurate. Under the OPPS, each APC is assigned a cost weight based on the geometric mean costs   of all the procedures assigned to that APC. These estimated costs are derived from hospital charges adjusted   to   costs   using   each   hospital’s   cost   to   charge   ratio   (CCR).   Rather than   estimating   the   costs   of each resource on a per line-item basis, this ratio is an average at the hospital department level. Since the creation of the OPPS, this averaging mechanism has consistently resulted in charge compression. CMS defines charge compression as the “practice of applying a lower charge markup to higher cost services   and a higher charge markup to lower cost services.” As a result, the cost-based weights may reflect some aggregation bias, undervaluing high-cost items and overvaluing low-cost items when an estimate of average markup, embodied in a single CCR, is applied to items of widely varying costs in the same cost  center. For the over 8,000 CPT/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes that have “Active” or “Restricted Coverage” status the CY2024 MFS NPRM Addendum B, there are only 162 unique   APC   codes   in   the   CY2024   OPPS   NPRM   addendum   B.   Over   3,000   of   the   CPT/HCPCS   codes   that are “Active” or have “Restricted Coverage” status do not even have an assigned APC code. If   and   how   CMS   should   balance   factors   that   influence   indirect   PE   inputs   when   these   factors   are likely driven by a difference in geographic location or setting of care, specific to individual practitioners (or practitioner types) versus other specialty/practice specific characteristics (for example, practice size, patient population served)? In   the   PPI   study,   the   AMA   and   Mathematica   are   controlling   the   number   of   sampled   practices   within   strata defined by (1) specialty,   (2) proportion of time in the facility setting,   (3) practice size, (4) ownership   type (individual ownership vs. more complex ownership types), (5) geographic region, and among practices with complex ownership, whether (6) the practice is part of a vertically integrated health system, and (7) private equity ownership. The AMA and   Mathematica are using   these criteria for our Initial sampling, and if there is variance in   the response rates between different practice types, we will also use these criteria to adjust the sampling midway   through   the   data   collection   period.   Finally,   the   AMA   and   Mathematica   will   develop   final   analysis weights to adjust for the probability of selection, practice eligibility, and cooperation, ensuring selected weighted   totals   match marginal population   totals   from   the sample   frame. In the survey itself,   participating practices   are   asked to split   out their provider   compensation and   time, staffing and   other direct   and indirect practice expenses at the Medicare specialty level, if possible. The   AMA   and   Mathematica   could   provide   recommendations   related   to   this   question   once   the   PPI   survey is completed. The PPI sampling and weighting methodology should account for most of these factors. What   possible   unintended   consequences   may   result   if   CMS   were   to   act   upon   the   respondents’ recommendations for any of highlighted considerations above? Medicare payment differentials between the MFS and the OPPS are significant and have been growing, and this may be a factor in the decline in private practice. In fact, physician survey data indicate that payment   and   practice   costs   are   two   of   the   three   leading   reasons   for   private   practices   selling   to   hospitals   or health systems.   It is important to ensure that any potential changes to CMS practice expense methodology do not further exacerbate this relationship and instead work towards correcting site of service inconsistencies. In last year’s NPRM, CMS provided an impact table related to the initiative of rebasing and revising the MEI weights. CMS noted that implementation of that change in the PE methodology would have shifted  payment weights from physician work to practice expense principally favoring Diagnostic Testing   Facility   (+13   percent),   Portable   X-Ray   Supplier   (+13   percent),   Independent   Laboratory   (+10   percent),   and Radiation Therapy Centers (+6 percent) to the detriment of Cardiothoracic Surgery (-8 percent), Neurosurgery (-8 percent), Emergency Medicine (-8 percent), and Anesthesiology (-5 percent). Modest increases occur to specialties who provide services in the office with extremely expensive disposable supplies embedded into physician payment. Primary Care would face decreases (Family Medicine (-1  3   Kane CK. Recent Changes in Physician Practice Arrangements: Shifts Away from Private Practice and Towards Larger   Practice   Size   Continue   Through   2022.   Chicago   (IL):   American   Medical   Association;   2023.   Policy   Research Perspective 2023.  percent), Geriatrics (-2 percent), Internal Medicine (-2 percent) and Pediatrics (-2 percent)).  Similar to   that separate policy change, other changes to the PE methodology would  cause massive shifts between specialties, as well as within specialties, and put the solvency of many physician practices and other   health   care   organizations   in   jeopardy.   Any   changes   that   are   considered   should   be   made   carefully   to   ensure they reflect actual practice costs incurred by physician practices. All changes that impact physician practices should be phased in. Whether   specific   types   of   outliers   or   non-response   bias   may   require   different   analytical approaches and methodological adjustments to integrate refreshed data? The AMA and Mathematica will develop final analysis weights to adjust for probability of selection, practice   eligibility,   and   cooperation,   ensuring   selected   weighted   totals   match   marginal   population   totals from the sample   frame. The   AMA   and Mathematica   will evaluate the potential   for   nonresponse bias by conducting a nonresponse bias analysis. The AMA and Mathematica are using strata for our initial sampling, as described above. Also, if there is variance in   the response rates between different practice types, these criteria will be utilized to adjust the sampling midway through the data collection period.

We strongly urge the agency to further refine its utilization assumption to reflect the significant ambiguity about when to appropriately use this code and to avert an unwarranted permanent reduction to the Medicare conversion factor. The AMA greatly appreciates CMS’s proposed reassessment of G2211 utilization in 2024 in response to AMA advocacy.  CMS proposes to mitigate anticipated cuts due to the budget neutrality impact of adding the new E/M add-on code, G2211, which was finalized in 2021 but then delayed for three years by Congress. Specifically, CMS has lowered the estimated utilization assumption of the add- on   code   from 90   percent   in   its   2021   rule   to   38   percent   when   initially   implemented   in   2024   and   54   percent  4   Id . once   the   code   has   been   fully   adopted.   Unfortunately,   despite   these   revisions,   G2211   continues   to   drive   a significant   payment   reduction   to   the   MPS   overall.   CMS   notes   that   approximately   90   percent   of   the   -2.17 percent budget neutrality adjustment is attributable to G2211. The AMA has raised several considerations that will reduce physicians’ readiness and willingness to report G2211.  This code was initially proposed to offset the payment cuts facing certain specialists who more often bill higher-level E/M visits as part of   CMS’s 2019 MFS proposal to collapse Levels 2-5 and   subsequently   Levels   2-4.   However,   in   response   to   blanket   opposition   from   organized   medicine   about the proposal to collapse the office visits, CMS ultimately abandoned that approach and instead adopted the CPT Editorial Panel’s revised coding guidelines for O/O E/M visits, as well as the RUC’s recommended increased valuation of those codes. This effort was the result of substantial collaboration among all of medicine. Despite this shift in policy, CMS retained G2211. However, the agency has not clearly explained how G2211 works within the revised O/O E/M coding framework. With physicians now billing a higher-level E/M   code   for   more   complex   patient   counters,   it   is   not   clear   when   an   add-on   code   would   be   a   substitute   for billing a higher-level E/M visit. Should physicians bill the add-on code when they determine the E/M   code level based on time, medical decision-making, or both? How do physicians ensure that the add-on code does not duplicate work or time already counted for in higher- level E/M codes? We also believe patient cost-sharing may be a barrier to uptake of this code as physicians will understandably be hesitant to label patients as “complex” and potentially cause them to incur an   additional out-of-pocket cost for their office visits as a result. We have seen this with the other Medicare care   management   codes.   Further,   the   expense   will   have   a   disproportionate   impact   on   low-income   patients. In   addition,   in   a   prior     the   Medicare   Payment Advisory   Commission   ( MedPAC ) raised   the important question of how physicians will document that they are reporting G2211 appropriately without a more detailed description of the code. We have heard questions from physicians about how a single, serious condition will be defined.  Without further clarity, physicians will be less likely to report this code, and it calls into serious question CMS’s assumption that more than one-in-three office visits will include this add-on code in 2024. CMS has previously overestimated physicians’ readiness and willingness to report new codes that were not revaluations of existing codes. For example, the utilization estimates for TCM services are a cautionary tale. In 2013, CMS overestimated utilization for new TCM codes 99495 and 99496, resulting in a budget offset of $773 million in 2013. This reduction was permanently removed from the MPS, reducing annual physician spending significantly each year since implementation. As shown in the chart below,   this   overestimate   has   resulted   in   a   cumulative   reduction   of   $5.23   billion   through   2021.   CMS   must not repeat this mistake with G2211.  The   AMA   is   not   alone   in   raising   concerns   about   potential   overestimates   about   how   often   physicians   and other practitioners will use G2211. The RUC    includes a detailed analysis of the outstanding   questions   and   ambiguities   about   the   add-on   code.   We   urge   CMS   to   address   the   issues   raised by the RUC and their impact on the utilization of G2211, including the following: There   is   a   lack   of   clarity   about   the   exact   additional   resources   that   CMS   intends   to   capture   by creating G2211, and the typical patient to receive G2211 services is not well-defined. Medicare contractors, compliance officers and other stakeholders will face significant challenges in   effectively   educating   and   auditing   health   care   practitioners   on   the   proper   reporting   of   this   code. The CMS method to predict these precise estimates was not published. It appears that CMS excluded   the   claims   with   modifier   -25   and   then   assumed   50   percent   of   the   remaining   visits   would include the reporting of G2211. However, CMS should confirm its method and share this information publicly. In   addition,   the     (ACP)   and   the     (AAFP), whose members will use G2211, have both urged CMS to revise downward the utilization estimates for G2211. ACP argued that utilization should be less than 10 percent of all office visit codes, stating the following: An equivalent in the surgical setting is modifier 22, appended when a procedure exceeds the normal range of complexity, which is only used in specific instances where the procedure is unusually   challenging.   CMS   should   reevaluate   the   utilization   estimates,   including   an   examination of actual utilization of similar codes implemented in recent years, such as chronic care management (CCM) and transitional care management (TCM) services, which has been lower than   expected.   Although   two-thirds   of   Medicare   beneficiaries   are   eligible   for   CCM   services,   these codes account for only 2.3 percent of all claims. Similarly, TCM services were only found on 9.3 percent   of   claims   for   the   total   eligible   population   of   22   percent.   This   report   suggested   that   a   more accurate estimate for G2211 would be far below CMS original projection. In addition, to inform CMS’s utilization estimate, we urge the agency to look at its own data on the Medicare   Access   and   CHIP   Reauthorization   Act   of   2015   (MACRA)   Patient   Relationship   modifiers, which were established for voluntary reporting in 2018. Two of the modifiers – X1 and X2 – are used to indicate a longitudinal, continuous physician-patient relationship at the time of the service, which is consistent with the G2211 code description. For example, X1 is to be reported for primary care services and specialists providing comprehensive care to patients in addition to specialty care. For X2, a reporting clinician service example is a rheumatologist taking care of a patient’s rheumatoid arthritis longitudinally but   not   providing   general   primary   care   services.   By   looking   at   the   use   of   these   two   modifiers,   CMS   would have a more data-driven method to estimate the likely use of G2211. Furthermore,   CMS  \n",
            "string indices must be integers\n",
            "Error processing text 6: is   proposing   to   codify   its   prior   guidance   that   it   would   not   be   appropriate   to   bill   G2211 with an E/M visit that includes modifier -25. In    about G2211, the agency states that it would not expect G2211 to be reported with other payment modifiers, such as -24 and -53. The AMA urges CMS to further codify these instructions against reporting the E/M add-on code with a payment modifier and incorporate them into the utilization estimate. In addition, this CMS guidance describes G2211 as a service that results in “a comprehensive, longitudinal, and continuous relationship with the patient and involve[s] delivery of team-based care that is accessible, coordinated with other practitioners and providers, and integrated with the broader health care landscape.” This guidance indicates that G2211 would involve team-based care and care coordination for the patient, both elements that   go   beyond   the   code   descriptor   and   indicate   that   reporting   of   this   code   should   be   more   discerning   than CMS otherwise considers in this rule. The AMA and   others   have   highlighted   several   likely barriers   to uptake   of   this code, including   ambiguity about when to use it and how to document it, as well as concerns about patient cost-sharing obligations. Unfortunately, as noted above, although the utilization assumption has been greatly reduced, the add-on code will still lead   to   an additional across-the-board   cut to   the conversion   factor due to budget neutrality requirements.   The   AMA   strongly   urges   CMS   to   further   refine   its   utilization   assumptions   for   G2211 to avert an unwarranted permanent reduction to the conversion factor.  Global   Surgical   Codes Recommendation : CMS   should   reconsider   its   decision   and   increase   the   office   visit   E/M   bundled   into   the   global surgery payment consistent with the 2021 O/O E/M revaluations. In our discussion of the E/M changes, the AMA would be remiss not to mention our long-standing    that CMS   apply   the   office   visit   increases   to   the   visits   bundled   into   global surgery   payment.   As   we have stated previously, the surgical specialties participated in the RUC survey and their data were the same as, and often greater than, primary care and other specialties. CMS has emphasized the robust survey utilized in the valuation of office visits and this survey demonstrates what the law requires, all physicians should receive the same payment for the same service. Increasing   the   visits   bundled   into   the   surgical   global   payment   would   increase   spending   by   approximately $440   million,   requiring   an   approximate   0.4   percent   reduction   to   the   Medicare   conversion   factor   but   it would help mitigate the redistributive impacts of G2211. Request   for   Comment   About   Evaluating   E/M   Services   More   Regularly   and   Comprehensively CMS   responds   to   comments   by   consultants   and   others   by   asking   a   series   of   questions   about   the   process used to value physician services. The CMS questions, and corresponding AMA responses, are listed  below. Do   the   existing   E/M   HCPCS   codes   accurately   define   the   full   range   of   E/M   services   with appropriate gradations for intensity of services? The   current   E/M   codes   accurately   define   the   full   range   of   E/M   services   as   they   exist   today.   However,   the CPT and RUC processes strive to identify new technology and gaps in coding and valuation as the practice of medicine evolves. Also,   anyone   may submit   a coding application if they perceive any gaps in E/M coding. The CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC will continue to describe and evaluate new E/M services as they arise. The recent extensive revisions of the E/M services specifically addressed the granularity of services by allowing for reporting by medical decision making or time on the date of the encounter (straightforward, low,   moderate,   and   high),   which   was   enhanced   by   the   development of   coding   for   prolonged   services.   The CPT   Editorial Panel and   the RUC   have a   long   history   of     CMS   has   not   always   accepted   the   RUC   recommendations   for   these   types   of   services,   sometimes only partially accepting RUC recommendations   to   increase   valuation. For example, in   the   first Five-Year Review of the RBRVS, CMS did not fully implement the RUC recommended increases to office visits. Codes were also created by the CPT Editorial Panel, and CMS classified them as bundled into existing services. For example,   in   the immediate months of the PHE, the CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC urged CMS to pay for a new code 99072  Additional supplies, materials, and clinical staff time over and above those usually included in an office visit or other non-facility service(s), when performed during a Public Health Emergency, as defined by law, due to respiratory-transmitted infectious disease . However, the CPT   Editorial   Panel   and   the   RUC   persisted   in   defining   and   valuing   primary   care   and   E/M   services.   Some examples of the CPT Editorial Panel and RUC work, include: Medical   Home   –   The   RUC   engaged   in   an   extensive   process,   involving   several   stakeholders   in developing a recommendation regarding the monthly resource costs of engaging in a medical home model of care. CMS did not implement these recommendations, resulting in medical home monthly payments that are significantly lower than the costs estimated by the RUC. Care Management – More than a decade ago, the CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC developed chronic care management and transitional care management codes to describe services that have long been performed, but never compensated. The number and scope of care   management   codes   has   grown   as   the   CPT   Editorial   Panel   considered   coding   applications for these services. Immunization Administration – The RUC strongly advocated for physician work valuation for   immunization   administration   to   reflect   the   counseling   that   physicians   and   qualified   health care professionals must provide to encourage vaccination. The CPT Editorial Panel and RUC’s   work   on   COVID-19   immunization   codes   during   the   recent   PHE   was   critical to   public health efforts in the US. Evaluation   &   Management   (E/M)   -   The   CPT/RUC   Workgroup   on   E/M,   with   significant specialty society involvement, revised the E/M office visit code descriptors and documentation   guidelines   that   directly   address   administrative   burden   by   simplifying   the reporting and documentation process. Changes included allowing physicians to choose whether their selection is based on medical decision-making or total time on the date of the encounter.   The   RUC   recommendations   to   increase   valuation   were   accepted   and   implemented by CMS in 2021. CMS implemented similar revisions and valuation improvements, created, and recommended by the CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC, to other E/M visit code sets, including inpatient and observation visits, emergency medicine visits, nursing facility visits, and home visits in 2023. Telemedicine   E/M   Services   –   As   telemedicine   and   remote   monitoring   services   surged   during the COVID-19 PHE, the CPT Editorial Panel and the RUC have responded to these new technology needs with coding and valuation solutions. Are   the   methods   used   by   the   RUC   and   CMS   appropriate   to   accurately   value   E/M   and   other HCPCS codes? Yes, the methods used by the RUC and CMS are appropriate to accurately value E/M and other HCPCS codes. The underlying methodology developed by Harvard University and CMS (formerly, the Health Care Financing Administration) in the late 1980s remains relevant today. Harvard conducted surveys of practicing physicians to measure time and the relativity of physician services utilizing magnitude estimation. All improvements since this time have been open to public comment via rulemaking. The RUC   and   CMS   have   developed   numerous   standards/policies/conventions   to   improve   relativity   and   ensure consistency. Standard packages for pre-service time, post-service time, practice expense direct input benchmarks, and pre-service clinical staff time packages have been implemented, allowing for enhanced relativity and comparison among all services. The RUC is engaged and eager to offer process improvement, both in its survey process and its use of extant data sources. More than 100 national medical specialty societies and other health care   organizations participate in the RUC process. These organizations devote significant resources and expertise to conducting physician surveys. In recent years, the median number of survey respondents is 70, with surveys for high volume services having more than 100 physician respondents. As noted, the recent   office   visit   RUC   survey   yielded   the   highest   number   of   responses   in   the   history   of   the   RUC   process, with 1,700 physicians completing the survey. The survey was the concerted effort of 51 specialty   societies and other health care professional organizations who represented 95 percent of Medicare claims for E/M office visits. The RUC incorporates extant data when possible, such as data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American College of Cardiology, and National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). One methodological   improvement   that CMS   should consider   is   to restore the Refinement Panel process, which served as an appeal process for those commenting on CMS proposed relative values. The refinement   panel   was   comprised   of   physicians   and   contractor   medical   directors.   In   2016,   the   AMA,   with over 90 specialty societies,     the restoration of the refinement panel.  The AMA again   requests that CMS reinstate the Refinement Panel process. Are   the   current   Non-E/M   HCPCS   codes   accurately   defined? Yes,   the   current   non-E/M   HCPCS   codes   are   accurately   defined   through   the   CPT   Editorial   Process.   The CPT Editorial Panel process benefits from a collaborative and transparent process comprising many national medical specialty   societies,   private   health   care   insurers,   hospital associations,   and   government affiliates. Further, medical specialty societies, individual physicians, hospitals, third-party payers, and other interested parties may submit applications for changes to CPT for consideration by the CPT Editorial Panel. The RUC also submits recommendations to CPT for coding changes resulting from its Relativity   Assessment   Workgroup   (RAW)   process.   The   CPT   Editorial   Panel   considers   applications   using objective criteria, including stringent literature requirements. In addition to structured criteria for CPT code change applications that maintain consistency, the CPT Editorial Panel also works with Panel members, CPT Advisors, and applicants during   the preparation and   consideration   of each proposal. Over a minimum of three meetings per year, the CPT Editorial Panel addresses over 200 major topics, each reviewed and discussed with careful consideration. The CPT Editorial Panel and those that participate in the   process   have   maintained   a   respected   method   that   is   best   suited   to   preserve   accurately   defined   medical  codes. Are   the   methods   used   by   the   RUC   and   CMS   appropriate   to   accurately   value   the   non-E/M   codes? The MFS is a resource-based  relative  value scale, and it is important that all services be examined via the same methodology. The fact that this question distinguishes “non-E/M services” from “E/M services” is problematic,   as all services should be valued using   the same methodology   to ensure fairness,   consistency, and relativity. The benefit of the Resource Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) is that it measures resources   in   determining   relativity,   versus   introducing   bias   or   politics   into   the   valuation   process.   As   stated earlier, the RUC, CPT, HCPAC, and CMS continuously evolve to provide process improvement, but statutory and regulatory rules cannot be unwound instantaneously. For instance, the physician work definition cannot be modified by the RUC. What   are   the   consequences   if   services   described   by   HCPCS   codes   are   not   accurately   defined? There are HCPCS I (CPT) and HCPCS II (CMS) codes. CPT Category I non-vaccine codes are created three times a year by the CPT Editorial Panel at open meetings. The process begins with an application that is open to review by all the specialty advisors, including non-physician health care professionals. CPT Editorial Panel reviewers interact with applicants as needed to refine applications. The interactive process promotes coding clarity with descriptors, readily accessible guidelines and parentheticals that direct correct coding in potentially confusing circumstances and exclusionary parentheticals. At the CPT Editorial   Panel   meetings,   if   not   before,   CPT   Editorial   Panel   experts   seek   to   amend   any   shortcomings   or   to defer   the   application   decision   until   essential   questions   are   resolved.   At   the   CPT   Editorial   Panel   table   are   a diverse group of specialties and professions, payer representatives, coding professionals and RUC representatives. Attendees may comment. The CPT Editorial Panel process is highly interactive and efficient with a high probability of producing accurately defined services. When there is concern about accuracy of definition, the CPT Assistant Editorial Board, the CPT Editorial Panel Executive Committee and/or the CPT Editorial Panel provide clarity and may revise CPT text as needed. The RAW process helps to identify lack of clarity or the need for change in descriptions due to changing technology. The CPT Editorial Panel recognizes that services must be accurately defined so they may be accurately   valued, so program integrity is supported, so health services utilization can be monitored, and so public health can be advanced. HCPCS II codes are developed by CMS with application periods twice per year. HCPCS II codes are generally used to report services, supplies, and services not included in CPT codes. However, there are some instances where CMS creates codes that almost mirror CPT codes for the purpose of changing the reporting requirements. For example, add-on code 99417 for prolonged E/M services was added to the CPT   2021   code   set,   effective   January   1,   2021.   In   lieu   of   covering   code   99417   for   Medicare,   CMS   elected to create similar code G2212. For CPT 2023, code 99418 was created for prolonged services in the inpatient setting. However,   in the 2023 Final Rule, CMS affirmed that CPT codes   for prolonged   services will not be payable and created G0316 to report prolonged inpatient or observation care services, G0317 to   report   prolonged   nursing   facility   services,   and   G0318   for   prolonged   home   or   residence   services.   The result of these differing coding methodologies for reporting prolonged services further deepens the administrative burden for health care professionals and increases the potential for improper coding. Further,   the   CMS   developed   HCPCS   II   G-code   descriptors   for   prolonged   services   created   in   lieu   of   the CPT code set that was thoroughly refined via the CPT Editorial Panel process, which included multi- specialty input by expert physicians and QHPs. It is imperative that physicians have one set of clear codes and guidelines to report medical procedures and services. If other HCPCS II codes are created that are not accurately defined, it could lead to   improper   reporting   of   medical   services   by   Medicare   and   other   insurers.   For   these   clearly   outlined   reasons, code descriptors should be properly vetted via an established, consistent process that includes physician and QHP input when developing the code to assure that no two codes are alike. Moreover, codes should be consistent without variation to increase   clarity   for all payers.   It is   critical   to ensure consistency   and   the validity of expertly   defined   medical codes by aligning   CMS coding policy and CPT coding requirements. What   are   the   consequences   if   services   described   by   HCPCS   codes   are   not   accurately   valued? The intent of the RBRVS   is   to ensure that   the   payment   of one   service is relative   to   the payment   of   another when   accounting   for   the   resources   consumed   in   the   provision   of   the   service.   If   the   relativity   of   one   service is undervalued, physicians may not be able to sustain the practice of providing that service in an office setting. Likewise, a significant overvaluation of a service may provide financial incentive to perform the service. The RUC created RAW to develop objective and fair screens to identify potentially misvalued services and address these issues. This process is transparent, and    CMS also considers public nomination of potentially misvalued services. Those that continuously criticize the valuation process might instead publicly comment on specific codes believed to be potentially misvalued, with objective data and rationale articulated. Should   CMS   consider   valuation   changes   to   other   codes   like   the   approach   in   section   II.J.5.   of   this  rule? CMS should NOT consider valuation changes like the approach in section II.J.5. of the  Proposed Rule.  The calculation proposed for the increase in the behavioral health services is not resource-based and has the   potential   to   distort   the   RBRVS.   The   statute   that   created   the   RBRVS   (Omnibus   Budget   Reconciliation Act of 1989, Public-Law 101-239, section 6102) requires that the relative values be based on resource  costs. It is understandable that policymakers wish to improve access to behavioral health care and address shortages   in   behavioral   health   workforce   capacity.   However,   these   initiatives   should   occur   via   legislation and are best addressed via transparent bonus payments, grants, loan forgiveness or other programs. Distorting   relativity   within   the   RBRVS   is   not   appropriate.   CMS   should   not   use   arbitrary   calculations to adjust specific services performed by one specialty to address issues outside of the scope of the RBRVS payment system. Access and shortage issues should be addressed through legislative solutions and properly funded. We are particularly interested in ways that CMS could potentially improve processes and methodologies,   and   we   request   that   commenters   provide   specific   recommendations   on   ways   that we can improve data collection and to make better evidence-based and more accurate payments for E/M and other services. It   is   important   to   clarify   that   the   RUC   submits   recommendations   to   CMS   regarding   resources   required   to provide a service. Congress and CMS determine the  payment  amount. The RUC is continuously   improving its processes to ensure it is best utilizing   reliable,   extant data. In 2013,   the   RUC   increased   the   minimum   number   of   respondents   required   for   each   survey   of   commonly performed codes: For   services   performed   one   million   or   more   times   per   year   in   the   Medicare   population,   at   least   75 physicians must complete the survey. For   services   performed   from   100,000   to   999,999   times   annually,   at   least   50   physicians   will   be  required. Further strengthening its methodology in 2014, specialty societies moved to a centralized online survey process, which is coordinated by the AMA   and utilized external expertise to ensure survey and reporting improvements. Over the last decade, the RUC has created and improved standard packages, such as pre- service time, post-service time, practice expense direct input benchmarks, and pre-service clinical staff time   packages.   These   packages   have   been   implemented,   allowing   for   enhanced   relativity   and   comparison among all services. The RUC also incorporates extant data when possible, such as data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, American College of Cardiology, and NSQIP. We are particularly interested in recommendations on ways that we can make more timely improvements   to   our   methodologies   to   reflect   changes   in   the   Medicare   population,   treatment guidelines and new technologies that represent standards of care. CPT and the RUC effectively respond to service description and resource-based valuation changes. New benefit categories, new practitioner or provider entity types, and codes that are program specific of necessity are not part of the CPT and RUC scope but may be addressed through legislation. CPT is an open process where any individual may make a code change application. It seeks to be responsive to changes in services and new technology. Treatment guidelines and standards of care commonly evolve more   slowly   than   coding,   but   not   always.   CPT   created   Category   III   codes   which   are   released   twice   a   year and have permissive criteria for creation, while being clearly defined. CPT has a strong history of responding to changes, most recently with the creation of coding related to COVID-19 vaccination. The RUC identifies, maintains, and reviews a list of new services and services that use new   technology, develops   objective   screens   to   identify   potentially   misvalued   services,   and   examines   all   services   in   which utilization estimates are more than expected. As the RUC identifies new technology services that should be re-reviewed, a list of these services is maintained and forwarded to CMS. Currently, codes are identified as new technology based on recommendations   from   the   appropriate specialty society and consensus   among RUC   members at the   time of the RUC review. The RUC considers several factors to evaluate potential new technology services, including recent FDA-approval, newness or novelty of the service, use of an existing service in a new or novel way, and migration of the service from a Category III to Category I CPT code. The RUC new technology/new services list currently contains 817 services. In September 2010, the re-review cycle began and since then the RUC has recommended 59 services to be re-examined. The remaining services are   rarely   performed   (i.e.,   less   than   500   times   per   year   in   the   Medicare   population)   and   will   not   be   further examined. The Workgroup will continue to review the remaining 296 services every April after three years of Medicare claims data are available for each service. Since the inception   of the RAW in 2006, it and CMS have identified over 2,700 services through over 20 different   screening   criteria   for   further review   by   the   RUC.   To   provide   Medicare   with   reliable   data   on   how physician work   has   changed over   time, the RUC, with   more than 300   experts in medicine   and   research, is examining 2,717 potentially misvalued services accounting for $45 billion in Medicare spending. The RUC has recommended reductions and deletions to 1,593 services, redistributing $5 billion annually. For every CPT code recommendation and family, the RUC submits utilization assumptions based on the specialty societies estimate for the next year of Medicare utilization. Starting with CPT 2009, the RAW began assessing all services for work neutrality. The RUC immediately examines the utilization assumptions   as   soon   as   actual   Medicare   utilization   data   is   available.   In   2012,   the   RUC   confirmed   that   the RUC and specialty societies work neutrality calculation expectation is a zero-change target. However, if actual work RVUs results in 10 percent or greater than the former work RVUs for   the family, the family will   undergo   review by   the   RAW. The Workgroup has   examined eight   code   families for work   neutrality. The RUC has either identified incorrect utilization assumptions, identified potential misreporting of services, recommended revisions to services via the CPT Editorial Panel, recommended extensive educational efforts, and/or recommended resurvey and review of services. CMS may improve their methodologies by improving access to Medicare and Medicaid data. Disseminating   Medicare   utilization   data   earlier   would   be   particularly   helpful   to   immediately   understand   if the utilization of this service is as anticipated.  The first quarter of Medicare claims data should be available by July 1st of each year. A full year of claims data should be available by April each year (example, 2023 data should be publicly available by April 2024).  Availability of Medicaid utilization data is also necessary to examine trends in services in the non-Medicare population.  The RUC has requested that CMS share recent Medicaid data to identify potentially misvalued services, and we urge the release of this information.  The RUC also notes the absence of Medicare Advantage claims data.   Since   the   number   of   patients   in   this   program   has   increased,   it   is   important   to   investigate   mechanisms to collect this information. We are also interested in recommendations that would ensure that data collection from, and documentation   requirements   for,   physician   practices   are   as   least   burdensome   as   possible   while also maintaining strong program integrity requirements. We   support   efforts   to   address   the   significant   administrative   burden   that   plague   physicians   and   other   health care professionals today. For this reason,   the RUC was active in   the effort to redefine the E/M descriptors and guidelines to ensure that documentation is utilized for clinical purposes and does not burden physicians to satisfy administrative or billing requirements. Physicians   and   other   health   care   professionals   have   limited   time   and   other   resources   to   participate   in   data collection efforts. The support of the national medical specialties and other health care professional organizations is imperative in obtaining adequate data on the resources required in the provision of  services. Finally,   we   are   also   interested   in   whether   commenters   believe   that   the   current   AMA   RUC   is   the entity that is best positioned to provide -recommendations to CMS on resource inputs for work and PE (Practice Expense) valuations, as well as how to establish values for E/M and other physicians’ services; or if another independent entity would better serve CMS and interested parties in providing these recommendations. The AMA strongly objects to this specific question. While we are supportive of the CMS queries related to process improvement to ensure that the RBRVS is accurate, to specifically call out the RUC in this manner   is   perplexing   and   unwarranted.   Most   importantly,   the   RUC   is   an   independent   entity,   comprised   of volunteer physicians and staffed and funded by the AMA, national medical specialty societies and other health care professional organizations. The RUC has a Constitutional Right to provide recommendations to the CMS on resource inputs for work and practice expense valuation. The First Amendment provides the freedom for individuals and entities to petition the government. The RUC process operates with full transparency. Detailed minutes, recommendations, and voting records   are   publicly     courtesy   of   the   AMA.   The   RUC   convenes   three   times   annually,   and   these meetings are accessible to registered observers through advanced sign-up via the AMA platform. The RUC’s recommendations contain granular data to describe the physician time, work relativity, clinical staff time, medical supplies and medical equipment used in providing services to patients. This information is collected by national specialty societies and other health care professional organizations with the involvement of hundreds of dedicated volunteers. The staff in each of the more than 100 organizations involved are experts in coding and the RBRVS. The clinical input and expertise of these individuals is imperative to ensure a fair, consistent, and resource-based payment system. CMS, at one time, attempted to retain consultants to determine practice expense direct inputs for each service described by CPT codes. The effort was riddled with inconsistency in methodology and produced data that   was   not   resource-based.   The   RUC,   initially   formed   by   organized   medicine   to   review   physician   work, quickly realized that it was necessary for physicians and other health care professionals to lead an effort to submit direct practice expense inputs to CMS to restore relativity and trust in the RBRVS. Simply stated, despite the efforts of others to foster division within medicine and minimize the influence of   the   RUC,   we   will   continue   to   represent   physicians   and   other   health   care   professionals   as   we   have   every right and responsibility to do so.  Split   or   Shared  Visits\n",

            "Error processing text 7: : The AMA recommends CMS adopt the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report a split or shared E/M visit and to implement this policy following the proposed one-year delay,   effective   Jan.   1,   2025,   to   ensure   physicians   and   other   practitioners   have   sufficient   time   to incorporate this guidance into their practice. The AMA supports the proposed delay, through Jan. 1, 2025, of the requirement that only the physician   or practitioner who spends more than half of the total time with the patient during a split or shared visit can bill for the visit. In its rationale for a delay, CMS cited    raised by the AMA and organized medicine   about   the   disruptions   to   team-based   care   in   the   facility   setting   that   would   result   from   this   policy. CMS also noted that the AMA CPT Editorial Panel is considering revisions to aspects of split or shared visits, which are final as of Sept. 1, 2023.  Therefore, we strongly urge CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report the E/M service and to implement this policy following the one-year delay, effective Jan. 1, 2025, to give physicians and practitioners sufficient time to incorporate this guidance into their clinical practice. The   new   CPT   guidance  states: Physician(s) and other qualified health care professional(s) (QHP[s]) may act as a team in providing care for the patient, working together during a single E/M service. The split or shared visits guidelines are applied to determine which professional may report the service. If the physician or other QHP performs a substantive portion of the encounter, the physician or other QHP may report the service. If   code selection is based   on total   time on   the date   of   the encounter, the   service   is   reported   by   the   professional who   spent   the   majority   of the   face-to-face   or   non-face- to-face   time performing   the   service.  For   the purpose of   reporting E/M services within the context of team-based   care,   performance of a substantive   part   of the   MDM requires that   the physician(s) or other QHP(s) made or approved the management plan for the number and complexity of problems addressed at the encounter and takes responsibility for that plan with its inherent risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality of patient management. By doing so, a physician or other QHP has performed two of the three elements used in the selection of the code level based on MDM. If the amount and/or complexity of data to be reviewed and analyzed is used by the physician or other QHP to determine the reported code level, assessing an independent historian’s narrative and the ordering or review of tests or documents do not have to be personally performed by the physician or other QHP, because the relevant items would be considered in formulating the management plan. Independent interpretation of tests and discussion of management plan or test interpretation must be personally performed by the physician   or   other   QHP   if   these   are   used   to   determine   the   reported   code   level   by   the   physician   or other QHP. These guidelines were developed by the CPT Editorial Panel with input from the CPT/RUC Workgroup on E/M, which is comprised of current and former members of both the CPT Editorial Panel and RUC and has a distinguished track record of significant collaboration among state medical and specialty societies in developing a framework for the revised E/M services that have been implemented by Medicare   across   health   care   settings.   CPT   terminology   is   the   most   widely   accepted   medical   nomenclature used across the country for E/M and all other medical services under public and private health insurance programs. Adoption of CPT guidelines for split or shared visits would reduce the ambiguity around how to report these codes since CMS revoked its previous definition of “substantive portion” and would ensure consistency and uniformity across the health care system. Importantly, adoption of this guidance would allow physicians or QHPs to report  split  or shared visits   based   on   time   or   medical   decision-making.   The   AMA   supports   physician-led,   team-based   patient care. Patients benefit from the collaboration of physicians and QHPs who care for patients in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other facilities, where they work  hand-in-hand . However, reporting only based on the physician or QHP who performs more than 50 percent of the total time of the visit will disincentivize the continuation of these care relationships. There is significant variability in how much time it takes to perform elements of the visit based on the level of training and expertise of the physician and QHP. For many patient visits, the medical decision making involved in directing the management of the patient’s care determines the course of treatment for the patient but may not require the most time. Just   as   is   the   case   now,   the   physician   or   QHP   who   performs   these   critical   elements   of   the   visit   should   be able   to adequately   report   the scenario   that is best for   their   patient.  For these reasons, we strongly urge CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for reporting split or shared visits.  Telehealth   Services Extension   of\n",

By   doing   so,   patients   nationwide   in   both   urban and rural areas will retain the ability to access telehealth services, particularly from their own homes. Based on the CAA, 2023, CMS is also extending payment for the CPT codes for audio-only telephone visits, 99441-99443 and 98966-98968, through 2024. CMS further proposes to continue payment for all other services that were on the 2022 Medicare Telehealth Services List in any category through 2024 when   they   are   provided   via   telehealth   and   to   delay   in-person   visit   requirements   for   telehealth   services   for patients with mental health conditions. The AMA deeply appreciates and strongly supports these policy proposals and urges that they be finalized.  The COVID-19 PHE clearly demonstrated the value of telehealth services and more broadly of digitally enabled medical care combining in-person, virtual, remote monitoring, and other service modalities   to deliver   care   that   meets patient needs. It   is   critically   important that   patients with   Medicare all over   the   United   States   be   able   to   continue   receiving   telehealth   services,   including   audio-only   services,   and that they can continue receiving them in their homes.

Under   the   previous   system,   services   in   Category   1   or   2   were   permanently   on   the   Medicare   Telehealth   List and those in Category 3, which were added during the COVID-19 PHE, were to remain on the list on an interim basis through 2023, at which time CMS would determine if it would remove them from the telehealth list or add them to one of the permanent categories. The AMA agrees with the agency that the new proposed categories of Provisional and Permanent are clearer and less likely to cause confusion.  Frequency   Limits   on  \n",

In comments on the 2023 Proposed Rule, the AMA raised concerns about the frequency limits of once every   14 days on   subsequent nursing facility visits provided   via telehealth   and recommended that these frequency limits be lifted permanently. CMS previously determined that it is not enforcing these limits during   2023.   The   current   rule   proposes   to   lift   the   frequency   limits   during   2024   and   seeks   information   to guide future policy beyond 2024. As we previously noted, the discussion in the 2021 rule regarding the reason for increasing the allowed frequency of subsequent visits from once every 30 days to once every 14 days failed to note that federal regulations at 42 CFR 483.30 already require that patients in a nursing facility “must be seen by a physician   at least once   every   30   days   for the   first   90   days   after admission,   and   at least once   every   60   days thereafter.” Effective May 7, 2022, one year prior to the expiration of the COVID-19 PHE, CMS reinstated   the   requirement   that   the   nursing   facility   patient   visits   required   by   these   federal   regulations   must be provided by   the physician in-person and cannot   be provided via   telehealth. Given that these   regulatory visits are already required to be provided in-person, the AMA again recommends that CMS remove the frequency limit on physicians furnishing subsequent nursing facility visits via telehealth. When a patient in a nursing facility develops a new problem or their condition is exacerbated such that they   need   to   see   a   physician,   the   visit   should   be   provided   in   the   most   expeditious   manner.   If   the   physician cannot quickly be in-person at the facility but could provide the visit via telehealth, that should be permitted. In addition, it is possible that the rapid availability of a telehealth visit in the nursing facility could help prevent avoidable patient transfers from nursing facilities to emergency departments.

CMS established policy in the 2023 final rule that,   for calendar year 2023,   Medicare would continue paying for telehealth   services at the non-facility payment rate instead of returning to its pre-PHE policy of paying for these services at the reduced facility payment rates that apply to services provided in hospital settings. (Although the facility rates are lower than the non-facility rates, for services provided in hospitals and other facility settings, Medicare   makes   a   separate   payment   to   the   facility   in   addition   to   the   payment for the   physician   service.) In the current rule, CMS proposes to align with the telehealth-related flexibilities that were extended via the CAA, 2023, by continuing to pay for telehealth services provided to patients in their homes at the non- facility payment rate for 2024 when the services are reported with POS 10. The AMA appreciates CMS’s recognition that physicians who provide both in-person office services and telehealth services need to receive sufficient compensation to cover the expense of maintaining their medical office.  Direct  Supervision Recommendation: The   AMA\n",

            "Error processing text 12: recommends   that   CMS   permanently   allow   the   supervising   physician   to   be   present   and immediately available through real-time audio and visual interactive telecommunications. During   the PHE   and continuing   through calendar year   2023, CMS has   modified   the definition of Direct Supervision   to allow   this supervision to be provided   through the presence   and   immediate   availability of the supervising practitioner through real-time audio and visual interactive telecommunications. In the current rule, CMS proposes to extend this definition of Direct Supervision through the end of calendar year   2024   and   seeks   information   about   future   policy   on   virtual   Direct   Supervision   for   2025   and   beyond. The AMA supports the proposal to continue the current policy through 2024 allowing the supervising physician to be present or immediately available through real-time audio and visual interactive telecommunications and, as we have previously stated, the AMA recommends that this policy be made permanent. That remote supervision may be inappropriate in some cases does not justify refusing to pay for it under any circumstance. In many rural and underserved areas patients may be unable to access important   services   if   the   only   physician   available   has   to   supervise   or   deliver   services   at   multiple   locations and may not be available to supervise services in-person when all patients need them. Failure to allow supervision via interactive telecommunications could mean that a patient would be unable to receive the service at all, rather than forcing in-person supervision to occur. Both patients and CMS rely on physicians’ professional judgment to determine the most appropriate services to deliver; the same principle should apply to how supervision is provided.

            "Error processing text 13:   Services  Recommendation: The AMA recommends that this section be modified in the final rule as we are concerned that many of the statements in the Proposed Rule that are intended only to clarify CMS policy on reporting   of   remote   monitoring   services   actually   create   new   restrictions   on   the   use   of   these   codes that go beyond the intended guardrails adopted by the CPT Editorial Panel. The AMA commends CMS for its efforts to increase patient access to remote monitoring services and thanks CMS for responding to questions and requests for clarification from remote monitoring interested parties. While some of the clarifications are helpful, the AMA is concerned that many of the statements reinforce or create new restrictions which go beyond the intended guardrails of the CPT Editorial Panel. The AMA acknowledges that CMS has the authority to implement more stringent restrictions on how CPT codes can be reported for Medicare beneficiaries, but we fear that if implemented as outlined in this Proposed   Rule,   the   clarifications   will   increase   administrative   burden   and   discourage   appropriate   reporting of these services. Further, the clarifications have the potential to create unnecessary complexity in an innovative and rapidly evolving area of digital medicine and may prevent physicians from being able to access necessary services for their patients that could greatly improve patient outcomes. We also remind CMS that the CPT Editorial Panel process is a transparent, rigorous process that very deliberately and thoughtfully develops coding and guidelines that foster appropriate reporting. The CPT Editorial Panel delivers codes and guidelines that are well reasoned and vetted; if CMS wants to ensure appropriate access to remote monitoring services with the goal of higher quality patient care, there is no reason to implement clarifications that will limit use beyond what is stipulated in the CPT guidelines. As it will be relevant to our comments on this section and to alleviate further confusion, the AMA would like to clarify the codes defined as remote physiologic monitoring (RPM), remote physiologic monitoring treatment management (RPMTM), remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) and remote therapeutic monitoring treatment management (RTMTM). Often stakeholders, CMS, and even the AMA group these services   together   and   refer   to   them with   the   shorthand   RPM   and   RTM,   however,   there   are   distinctions   that impact appropriate coding that seem to be overlooked in CMS clarifications. The distinctions are especially relevant to the 16-day monitoring requirement addressed by CMS in clarification three.

The AMA appreciates CMS’s flexibility during the COVID-19 PHE in allowing for new patients to receive remote monitoring services. While the AMA is encouraged that patients who received initial remote monitoring services during the PHE are considered established patients for purposes of the CMS new patient requirement, we disagree that the new patient requirement is necessary. While some codes specify   if   a   patient   is   new   or established,   these   codes   do   not,   and   the   AMA   encourages   CMS   to   eliminate the requirement. Although CMS initially limited RPM services to patients with chronic conditions, the agency clarified in the 2021 Proposed Rule ( ) that remote monitoring can be furnished   to patients with both   acute and chronic conditions. Since CMS   offered this clarification, it is logical that physicians should be able to utilize remote monitoring services for a new patient who presents with an acute illness. Limiting remote monitoring to only established patients is not only unnecessary but potentially   dangerous. There is a wide range of acute symptoms that a new patient could present with from COVID-19 to heart failure and, in many cases, RPM is an important element of high- quality   care   and   can   also   reduce   the   likelihood   of   additional   costly   care.   In   addition,   a   policy   of   excluding new patients assumes that the patient’s primary care physician is providing remote monitoring services themselves when we know that at many large health systems the primary care physician partners with a remote monitoring team. If the patient is required to be an established patient with the physician leading the remote patient monitoring program, that could create a separate and unnecessary intake visit after the patient’s primary care physician has already identified the need for remote monitoring services. Data   Collection   Requirements Recommendations: The   AMA   urges   CMS   to   remove   RTMTM   services   (98980,   98981)   from   its’   clarification   as   CPT guidelines do not require 16 days of monitoring to report these services. CMS should reconsider the limitation that only one physician or other QHP may report CPT codes 99453 and 99454, or CPT codes 98976, 98977, 98980, and 98981, during a 30-day period. The AMA appreciates CMS’s temporary exception to the 16-day monitoring requirement for remote monitoring services during the COVID-19 PHE. CPT guidelines do specify a requirement for at least 16 days of monitoring  over an episode of care  to report the education and set up codes (99453, 98975) for both RPM and RTM and at least 16 days  over a 30-day period  to report the device supply codes (99454, 98976,   98977,   98978)   for   both   RPM   and   RTM.   This   aspect   of   the   CMS   requirement   is   consistent   with   the current CPT guidelines and was intentional on the part of the CPT Editorial Panel when the codes were  developed. We strongly disagree with the CMS clarification requiring 16 days of monitoring for the RTMTM services (98980, 98981).  As explained above, within the CPT code set, RPMTM and RTMTM services are distinct from RPM and RTM, respectively. The CPT guidelines are clear that the 16-day monitoring requirement only applies to RPM and RTM, which are the CPT codes for the practice expense of the clinical staff time to set-up and educate the patient on the device and the practice expense of the equipment to supply the patient with the remote monitoring device. RTMTM services are for the physician work and associated clinical staff time to analyze and implement the data collected from the patient through monitoring. CPT guidelines state that “remote therapeutic monitoring treatment management services are provided when a physician or other QHP uses the results   of remote therapeutic monitoring to manage a patient under a specific treatment plan.” The CPT Editorial Panel carefully outlined the requirements to report treatment management services and they do not include at least 16 days of monitoring. This flexibility is intentional so that the physician or other QHP can provide the appropriate care to the patient and report the time that they spent on the patients care even when the physician   practice   does   not   provide   the   device   and/or   less   than   16   days   of   monitoring   takes   place.   Simply not meeting the requirements to report the device supply code should not prohibit the physician from reporting services performed when they spend at least 20 minutes of time in a calendar month on remote therapeutic monitoring treatment management. CMS goes on to state, “As a clarification for either RPM or RTM, only one practitioner can bill CPT codes   99453   and   99454,   or   CPT   codes   98976,   98977,   98980,   and   98981,   during   a   30-day   period,   and   only when at least 16 days of data have been collected.” The AMA contends that this is a misinterpretation of CPT guidelines. First, 98980 and 98981 should not be included in this statement for all the reasons stated previously. Second, the CPT guidelines are careful to set the framework that remote monitoring is provided for an episode of care and is part of a patient’s treatment plan. The AMA agrees with CMS that only   one   monitoring   device   should   be   reported   regardless   of   the   number   of   devices   provided   to   the   patient and the number of parameters monitored, however, this is for an episode of care for a specific condition,   it is not intended to limit treatment for patients who see separate physicians for separate episodes of care and would benefit from medical device(s) to monitor separate and distinct episodes of care. CPT guidelines are not intended to interfere with the physician’s ability to use their independent clinical judgement in deciding the best course of treatment for their patients. There may be a situation where a patient has comorbidities and would benefit from remote monitoring for two episodes of care. For  example: Comorbid   patient   is   under   the   simultaneous   care   and   supervision   of   the   following: Specialist   1   (Cardiologist)   who   is   remotely   monitoring   heart   failure   via   various   digital medical devices as defined by FDA including a weight scale, a blood pressure cuff monitor, and/or a single lead personal ECG monitor. Specialist   2   (Endocrinologist)   who   is   remotely   monitoring   diabetes   mellitus   via   various digital   medical devices as defined by FDA   including a   glucose   monitor, and a stand-on temperature monitoring system to assess inflammatory changes associated with foot  ulcers. Use   of   RPM   and   RTM   in   Conjunction   with   Other  Services Recommendation: A   patient   can   receive   RPM   and   RTM   services   if   they   are   reported   by   separate   physicians   or   other QHPs for separate and distinct episodes of care. The AMA thanks CMS for aligning with CPT guidelines and clarifying that RPM or RTM can be reported with care management services such as chronic care management and transitional care management if no time is double counted. We also agree that RPM and RTM should not be reported in conjunction   as   the   CPT   guidelines   indicate.   The   AMA   disagrees,   however,   with   the   CMS   statement   that “…services   associated   with   all   the   medical   devices   can   be   billed   by   only   one   practitioner,   only   once   per patient, per 30-day period, and only when at least 16 days of data have been collected….” The AMA contends that this represents another misinterpretation   of CPT guidelines. CPT guidelines are careful to set the framework that remote monitoring is provided for an episode of care and is part of a patient’s treatment plan. As referenced in comments for clarification two, separate physicians should be able to report remote monitoring for separate and distinct episodes of care. Other   Clarifications   for   Appropriate   Billing Recommendation: CMS should clarify that a physician or other QHP can report remote monitoring services separately   from   the   global   service   period   even   if   the   service   is   related   to   the   diagnosis   and episode of care for the global procedure  as long as  the work described is distinct. The AMA strongly urges CMS to reconsider this proposal, which would seriously limit the physician or other QHPs ability to use remote monitoring services based on their clinical judgment. CMS’s final clarification introduces a new concept to the discussion of appropriate reporting of remote monitoring services. While we agree with CMS that remote monitoring may be furnished separately from a global service   payment   for   a   procedure   or   surgery,   we   strongly   disagree   that   the   diagnosis   must   be   “…unrelated to the diagnosis for which the global procedure is performed….” or that the remote monitoring must be for “…an episode of care that is separate and distinct from the episode of care for the global procedure….”  RPM, RPMTM, RTM and RTMTM services are not included in the services provided as part of the surgical global period and can be incredibly useful in post-surgical care. CMS   should   allow   the   diagnosis   to   be   the   same,   if   the   work   described   by   the   CPT   code   is   separate   from the work described in the global period. For example, one study found that monitoring vital parameters with professional medical devices and using the findings to address postoperative medical issues following cardiac surgery reduced hospitalizations and potentially life-threatening complications.  Another example is RTM and RTMTM services to monitor a therapeutic response to physical therapy (PT). This type of service is typically excluded   from   the   CMS   global   period   for   joint   replacement   surgery   because   the   surgeon   does   not   provide PT services. However, it is related to the diagnosis for which the global surgical period is applied and is part of the episode of care. Remote therapeutic monitoring of PT should be separately reportable even though it is related to the underlying condition that the global procedure addressed.

            "Error processing text 14:   CMS   considers   how   teaching   physician’s   virtual   presence   could   continue   post   COVD- 19 PHE,   we   urge   CMS   to   maintain   virtual   supervision   of   residents   in   all   settings   permanently. The AMA applauds CMS   for its consideration   of the expansion of remote resident physician supervision. Originally, CMS was only going to allow remote resident supervision to occur post the COVID-19 PHE for teaching physicians when they were present for the key or critical portions of services involving residents through audio/video real-time communications technology (virtual presence), for services furnished in residency training sites that are located outside of an Office of Management and Budget (OMB)-defined   metropolitan   statistical   area   (MSA).   However,   CMS   is   considering   expanding   this   remote supervision option. CMS is now proposing to allow the teaching physician to have a virtual presence in   all   teaching settings when   the service   is furnished virtually (for   example, a 3-way   telehealth visit, with all parties in separate locations) through December 31, 2024. CMS is seeking comments and information to  8   Atilgan ,   K,   Onuk ,   BE,   Coşkun,   PK,   et   al.   Remote   patient   monitoring   after   cardiac   surgery:   The   utility   of   a   novel telemedicine   system.   J   Card   Surg.   2021;   36:   4226-4234.   help them consider how telehealth services can be furnished in all residency training locations beyond December 31, 2024, and what other clinical treatment situations are appropriate to permit the virtual presence of the teaching physician. Additionally, CMS is seeking information on how the teaching physician’s   virtual   presence   could   continue   to   support   patient   safety,   while   meeting   the   clinical   needs   for all   patients,   and   ensure   burden   reduction   without   creating   risks   to   patient   care   or   increasing   opportunities for fraud. The AMA appreciates CMS’s decision in the 2021 MFS to permanently allow virtual supervision of residents for certain types of services in non-metropolitan areas; however, we have been hearing from multiple physician groups within our Federation of Medicine, as well as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), how important the virtual supervision of residents has become post the COVID-19 PHE and how vital it is to permanently continue this additional supervision option regardless of location. Therefore, as CMS considers how teaching physician’s virtual presence could continue post the   COVD-19   PHE,   we   urge   CMS   to   maintain   virtual   supervision   of   residents   in   all   settings   permanently. While   we   commend   CMS   for recognizing   the   importance   of   access   to   care   in   rural   areas,   it   is   important to recognize that significant workforce shortages are also impacting access to care in other regions of the country. According to data from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), as of April 24, 2023, 160 million people currently reside in a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) and there are 8,200 fewer practitioners than are needed.  Approximately 25 percent of mental health HPSAs are located in urban areas and 24 percent span both rural and non-rural areas.  Currently, 99 million people reside in a Primary Care Shortage Area and there are 17,199 primary care practitioners that are needed. Additionally,   a June 2021   report   from   the AAMC   predicts   a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034.  These shortages have a real impact on access to care for patients. In addition, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) recently amended its rules   to   allow   for   audio/visual   supervision   of   residents   and   its   guidelines   now   state   that   direct   supervision can occur when “the supervising physician and/or patient is not physically present with the resident and the supervising physician is concurrently monitoring the patient care through appropriate telecommunication technology.”  Therefore, in accordance with ACGME guidance, the AMA acknowledges and supports individually tailoring the virtual supervision of each resident according to their level of competency, training, and specialty since this would enable residents to provide additional services while still garnering the support needed from their teaching physicians. However,   guardrails   should   be   included   in   order   to   ensure   virtual   supervision   is   delivered   efficaciously and to mitigate risk. As such, the AMA recommends: Decisions   regarding   how   residents   will   be   supervised   via   audio/visual   real-time   communication technology   should   be   implemented,   reviewed,   and   overseen   at   the   program   level,   in   accordance with ACGME policy.  9   HRSA   data   on   health   professional   shortage   areas   by   discipline   can   be   found   here:  10   Designated   Health   professional   shortage   areas   statistics,   Bureau   of   health   Workforce,   HRSA   (March   31,   2023)  11   AAMC,   The   complexities   of   physician   supply   and   demand:   projections   from   2019-2034   (June   2021)   can   be   found here  12      https://www.acgme.org/globalassets/pfassets/programrequirements/cprresidency_2023v3.pdf .  13   Training programs should lay out audio/visual supervision requirements in advance to promote consistent understanding between the resident and the teaching physician. Each program must define   when   the   physical   presence   of   a   supervising   physician   is   required,   and   each   resident   must know the limits of their scope of authority. Residency programs should encourage Residency Review Committees and ACGME to increase monitoring of clinical and educational work hour standards in the context of the larger issue of patient   safety   and   acknowledge   the   impact   of   the   changes   of   the   supervision   requirements   on   the residents and their optimal learning environment to ensure that appropriate education and supervision are maintained. Advice   should   be   provided   on   when   and   how   physicians   must   inform   the   patient   that   direct supervision by interactive telecommunication technology is being used. Since a teaching physician will still be required to review the resident physician’s interpretations and services, and ACGME has strict limits concerning supervision via interactive telecommunications technology,   the   AMA   believes   that   the   appropriate   level of patient   care   and   teaching   physician   direction will   be   maintained. Moreover, the permanent   addition   of audio/visual supervision   would not change   the responsibility of the institutions’ GME Committees which would still be required to monitor programs’ supervision   of   residents   and   ensure   that   supervision   is   consistent   with   the   provision   of   safe   and   effective patient care, the educational needs of residents, the progressive responsibility appropriate to residents’ level of education, competence, and experience, and any other applicable common and specialty/subspecialty specific program requirements. The AMA believes that—if ACGME rules are adhered to, and the use of audio/visual real time communication equipment is individualized to support the needs of residents, teaching physicians, and their patients—this   tool will be   effective   and   will provide   appropriate   supervision,   frequent evaluation, and open discussion. Therefore, in alignment with AAMC and ACGME, the AMA believes that there should   be   a   permanent   expansion   of   supervision   of   residents   via   audio/video   real-time   communications technology, beyond non-metropolitan areas, especially since these methods of supervision were successfully employed for multiple years throughout COVID-19 PHE.

            "Error processing text 15: Integration   Services, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Risk Assessment, and Principal Illness Navigation (PIN) Services Community   Health   Integration   (CHI)   Services Recommendations : The AMA supports CMS’s proposal to further incentivize screening for SDOH and referral to community support systems to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable inpatient, emergency department, and long-term care utilization. The AMA urges CMS to waive patient cost-sharing   for   CHI   services,   exclude   these   services   from   budget   neutrality,   expand   the   types   of services that qualify as initiating visits, finalize the provision of these services under general supervision of a physician, and better define the services and personnel who can provide the  service. CMS   proposes   to   establish   two   new   Healthcare   Common   Procedure   Coding   System   (HCPCS)   G-codes and   payment   rates   for   time-based   monthly   CHI   services   under   the   general   supervision   of   a   physician   to address SDOH that are significantly limiting the ability to diagnose or treat problems identified in an initiating E/M visit.    have found substantial evidence linking social circumstances, including access to healthy food, stable housing, and transportation, to health and to health outcomes. It is now understood that non-medical factors, such as SDOH, account for as much as 50 percent of a person’s health   outcomes.   When   one   or   more   of   these   conditions   pose   challenges,   such   conditions   can   become   risk factors for poor health outcomes, as well as for inequitable health outcomes, particularly for Black, Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI), and LGBTQ+ individuals, people who live in rural areas, and people with disabilities.  The AMA supports CMS’s proposal to further incentivize screening for SDOH and referral   to   community   support   systems   to   improve   health   outcomes   and   reduce   avoidable   inpatient, emergency department,   and   long-term   care utilization. The AMA   urges CMS   to   waive patient cost- sharing for CHI services, exclude these services from budget neutrality, expand the types of   services that qualify as initiating visits, finalize the provision of these services under general supervision of a physician, and better define the services and personnel who can provide the   service. The AMA has incorporated   work to   address SDOH, which   is already   being performed,   and encouraged it through changes to coding and payment. As CMS notes, the CPT Editorial Panel recognized in the revised CPT E/M Guidelines that SDOH needs can increase the complexity of a physician’s medical decision-making for an E/M visit and increase risk to the patient, when diagnosis or treatment is significantly limited by SDOH. CMS adopted these guidelines, effective in 2021. For example, with use of E/M   codes   99204   and   99205,   which   are   used   for   moderate   and   high   levels   of   medical decision-making (MDM) for a   new   patient,   and   99214   and   99215   for established   patients,   SDOH   factors   may   raise   the   risk of complications, morbidity, or mortality by limiting treatment options and diagnosis capability. We appreciate that CMS wishes to build on these efforts by establishing separate G-codes to promote Medicare beneficiary access to community-based social services (e.g., housing, utility, food assistance, and transportation) to address a patient’s health-related social needs (HRSN), the individual-level corollaries of community-level social determinants of health. First, to ensure that these services are accessible to the patients who need them the most, the AMA strongly   urges   CMS   to   explore   all   authorities,   including   working   with   the   states   and   with   Congress, to   waive patient cost-sharing for these   services.  Under current   policy,   Medicare   beneficiaries would be subject to a 20 percent co-insurance requirement to receive CHI services. Particularly for Medicare patients who are experiencing a HRSN, a majority of which are driven by financial hardship, out-of- pocket expenses can lead to delaying or foregoing these services. While    in this area is still growing and mixed for some interventions, there is promising evidence that well-designed and funded interventions lead to reduced health care utilization and costs. The Medicare program should reinvest these savings into waiving patient cost-sharing. Importantly, we believe CMS can also ensure greater access to these services by partnering with states to provide coverage of these services in their state Medicaid plans or coverage of cost-sharing for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Waiving patient cost-sharing would remove a significant barrier to uptake of care management services, including CHI. If   patient   cost-sharing   is   not   waived,   the   AMA   supports   a   requirement   to   obtain   patient   consent   during   the CHI initiating visit. Unfortunately, patient cost-sharing is a barrier to care for other care management services that CMS has previously established as beneficiaries are not accustomed to out-of-pocket costs for this type of care. Obtaining patient consent will help ensure patients are aware of their cost-sharing responsibilities, and we believe providing   this clarity   to   patients outweighs   the   additional burden imposed on physician practices to obtain informed consent. Second,   CMS   should   not   apply   budget neutrality   to   the   CHI   services   as   these   codes   establish   a   new benefit for beneficiaries.  CMS believes there is a gap in the current care management code set for integration   of community   services   provided   by   auxiliary   personnel,   including   community   health   workers or peers. As this is a new service being provided by a new set of personnel who were not previously eligible to provide billable services under Medicare, we believe  this falls  outside the scope of budget neutrality as a change in law or regulation. As the AMA has    with respect to other CMS-developed new services, such as G2211, we believe CMS has the authority to exclude changes in law and regulation, including SDOH risk assessment services,   which   affect   spending   from   the   calculation   of   budget   neutrality,   analogous   to   its   treatment   under the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) system of certain new benefits that increased spending but were outside   the   control of   the physician community.   Specifically, Section   4503   of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 1997 states that one of the four factors used to set the SGR is (emphasis added): (D) 1 plus   the Secretary’s estimate of   the percentage   change   (divided by 100)   in expenditures   for all physicians’ services in the fiscal year (compared with the previous fiscal year) which will result from  changes in law and regulations , determined without  taking into account  estimated changes   in   expenditures   resulting   from   the   update   adjustment   factor   determined   under   subsection (d)(3)(B) …. At a minimum, the AMA urges CMS to maintain a low utilization assumption for these services. As mentioned above regarding implementation of TCM, the uptake of these codes has historically been low and increasing the utilization assumption would result in a greater budget neutrality cut that physician practices   cannot   absorb   given   the   proposed   -3.36   percent   reduction   to   the   Medicare   conversion   factor   and projected 4.5 percent increase in practice costs as measured by the MEI. Third,   the   AMA   agrees   with   CMS   that the   Annual   Wellness   Visit   (AWV)   should   be   included   in   the list of  CHI  initiating services but only   when the physician or other practitioner bills for the service in order to meet “incident to” requirements and ensure care coordination. We also urge CMS to expand the list of  CHI  initiating services beyond office/outpatient E/M services and the AWV. Like the Biden Administration, the AMA is committed to tackling the issues surrounding maternal mortality and morbidity. Providing postpartum insurance coverage is crucial as it ensures new mothers receive necessary medical care and support during a vulnerable period, promoting their physical and mental well-being. This coverage also facilitates early detection and management of potential complications, contributing to healthier outcomes for mothers and newborns. To this end, we believe postpartum community   service   integration will be   an important use of these   new   services   but   requiring   an E/M or AWV to initiate the service would create a barrier to access as those codes are bundled into the maternity care codes. While Medicare does not cover many births, it is an industry leader, and public and private   plans   regularly   follow   its   determinations   on   coverage,   coding,   and   payment.   Therefore,   we   believe CMS should include the maternal care CPT codes, describing a bundle of services, on the list of  CHI  initiating visit codes. Similarly, we believe any visits by children qualifying for Medicare based on disability should also be included   under   CHI   initiating   visit   codes,   as   these   children   often   face   particular   challenges   that   are   time- sensitive in a child’s development. Further, we believe emergency department visits and observation status inpatient discharges should be included under CHI initiating visit codes, as HRSNs substantially contribute to these visits. Consideration should be given to including visits where there has been a substantial or sudden decline in medical (e.g., diabetes, cancer, end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease) or behavioral health (e.g., substance use disorder, serious mental illness) status or change in incarceration   status.   We   also   believe   patients   undergoing   major   surgery   would   benefit   from   CHI   services and urge CMS   to   include global surgical services, which also bundle the E/M visits into the code, on   the list of  CHI  initiating visits list. Fourth, we support CMS’s proposal to designate CHI services as care management services that may be furnished when the “incident to” billing requirements are met and under general supervision of the physician , which means the service is furnished under the physician’s overall direction   and   control,   but   the   physician’s   physical   presence   is   not   required.   Critical   to   the   success   of   CHI services will be the establishment of procedures to   ensure direct   communication between   the community health worker and the patient’s medical team. We believe general supervision is the appropriate level of supervision to facilitate this communication. Fifth, the AMA urges CMS to clarify the difference between non-clinical CHI services and clinical care management services, as well as adopt CPT guidance on   when   it is appropriate to bill for both PIN   and   other   care   management   services.   We   believe   Principal   Care   Management   (PCM)   codes   would be the appropriate service to report when community health integration is provided by a nurse, social worker, or other clinical staff. Further, we believe CMS’s proposal to allow a physician to bill separately for   other   care   management   services   during   the   same   month   as   CHI   could   lead   to   ambiguity   and   audit   risk. To reduce these concerns, we urge CMS to adopt CPT guidance that “each minute of service time is counted toward only one service. Do not count any time and activities used to meet criteria for another reported service. However, time of clinical staff and time of a physician or other qualified health care professional are reported separately when each provides distinct services to the same patient at different times during the same calendar month.” Physicians and their coding professionals are already familiar with this CPT guidance, thus adopting it will reduce confusion and help ensure uniformity in billing  guidelines. Finally, we urge CMS to better define the role of the auxiliary staff permitted to perform CHI services.  To ensure patients understand the role of the community health worker (CHW) or other   auxiliary staff providing CHI within the care team, we urge CMS to clarify that these staff should refrain from any activity that could be construed as clinical in nature, including interpreting test results or medical symptoms, offering second opinions, or making treatment recommendations. CHWs or peers should provide a supportive role for patients and, when necessary, help them understand medical information   provided   by   physicians   and   other   members   of   their   medical   care   team.   CHWs   or   peers   should fully disclose relevant training, experience,   and credentials,   in order to  help patients understand the scope of services the navigator is qualified to provide. They should also fully disclose potential conflicts of interest to those whom they service, including employment arrangements. As mentioned above, we believe CHI services provided by nurses, social workers or clinical staff would be more appropriately billed using the PCM codes.

The   pricing   of   these supplies should be based on a transparent process, where items are annually reviewed and updated. In the 2023 MPS Proposed Rule, CMS had initially proposed to bundle skin substitutes into its MPS practice   expense   payments   with   the   graft   application   procedures.   However,   due   to   substantial   push   back, it did   not finalize   this   policy.   In   this   Proposed   Rule,   CMS   indicates   that   it would   be   appropriate   to   take   a phased approach over multiple rulemaking cycles to examine how to appropriately incorporate skin substitutes as supplies under the MPS rate setting methodology. To this end, CMS is seeking comments about how best to establish appropriate payment for skin   substitute products under the MFS. In addition, CMS is seeking comments about cost-gathering approaches to establish direct PE input for skin substitute products and to develop payment rates for physician services that involve furnishing skin substitute products. The agency is also considering how   to account   for   these   products’   variability   and   resource   costs,   especially   as   new   products   increasingly   become  available. As the AMA understands it, the issue is primarily around the granularity in costs between separate supplies   in   this   area,   and   there   are   more   appropriate   mechanisms   for   CMS   to   address   the   underlying   issue than bundling skin substitutes into MPS practice expense payments. The AMA and the RUC have consistently over many years requested that CMS pay separately for high-cost supplies that are greater than $500. High variability in supply costs can create distortions and inadequate payment under the existing practice expense model of the RBRVS.  The AMA recommends   that CMS separately   identify and pay for high-cost disposable supplies priced at more than $500 using appropriate HCPCS codes. The pricing of these supplies should be based on a transparent process, where items are annually reviewed and updated. An analogy in this area is CMS’s current payment policy for paying separately for splint and cast supplies. Under current CMS policy, HCPCS Q-codes are utilized for separate payment of necessary supplies   along   with   the   CPT   codes   for   cast/strapping   procedures.   This   allows   for   price   granularity   across many different types of supplies, while maintaining consistency for the actual procedure reporting. The AMA is pleased that CMS is not proposing to change the terminology of these products to “wound management,”   as   we   previously   raised   concerns   that   this   would   differ   from   established,   consensus-driven CPT nomenclature and cause confusion and inconsistent reporting. We believe that the definitions listed in the CPT code set guidelines adequately describe skin substitute services. Creating deviation for these definitions, especially for primarily cost-related reasons, would create confusion across health care.

            "Error processing text 17: : The AMA supports CMS’s proposal to maintain the additional payment for in-home administration of the COVID-19 vaccine and to extend the additional payment for in-home administration   to   three   additional   preventive   vaccines.   We   urge   CMS   to   finalize   its   proposal   to increase the payment annually based on the increase to the MEI. CMS   should   consider   an   additional   payment   for   an   extended   visit   with   the   patient   or   an   extended commute to the patient. We   urge   CMS   to   clarify   that   billing   for   additional   unexpected   services   at   the   same   visit   is  permitted. CMS is proposing to maintain the additional payment for in-home administration of the COVID-19 vaccine   (HCPCS   code   M0201) and   to   extend   the   payment   for   in-home   administration   of three   additional preventive vaccines – the pneumococcal, influenza, and hepatitis B vaccines. The in-home additional payment   amount   is   $36.85   in   2023,   and   CMS   has   previously   finalized   that   it   will   be   updated   annually   by the percentage increase in MEI, which is projected to be 4.5 percent for 2024, and geographically adjusted.  The AMA supports CMS’s proposals as they would improve access to immunizations for Medicare beneficiaries. We also urge CMS to finalize its proposal to increase the in-home additional payment for vaccine administration based on the MEI, consistent with the increasing costs of providing vaccinations. We note, however, that CMS’s proposal does not appear to fully account for the unique needs and disparities   faced   by   specific   patient   populations.   People   from   marginalized   communities   and/or   with   more complex circumstances (e.g., rare diseases, disabilities) might require more time (in travel and during the visit) and   resources (e.g.,   vehicle gas and   mileage) expended by the clinician, which a flat payment might not cover, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities. In these cases, the payment rate may be inadequate to ensure access to in-home vaccines, preventing patients who need such services and are unable to or have difficulty commuting to a physician office or facility from getting the care they need. This   could   contribute   to   fragmented   care   and   compromised   patient   outcomes.   CMS   should   consider   an additional payment for an extended visit with the patient or an extended commute to the patient. CMS’s analysis of the use of this code found that it was being billed significantly more frequently for patients   who   are   harder   to   reach   and   that   may   be   less   likely   to   otherwise   receive   these   preventive   benefits. Between June 2021-June 2022, those 85 years of age and older were over three times more likely than younger beneficiaries to have received an in-home COVID-19 vaccination, and persons who are dual eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid were more than twice as likely than those who are not dual eligible to have received a COVID-19 vaccine provided in their home.  The AMA applauds CMS for expanding access to life-saving preventive vaccines to historically minoritized and marginalized patients, as well as older Americans who experience greater barriers to care. The agency is proposing to limit the additional payment to one payment per home visit, even if multiple vaccines are administered during the same home visit. CMS emphasized that every vaccine dose that is furnished would still receive its own unique vaccine administration payment. The agency would also extend the requirements   for   billing HCPCS code   M0201, including   that the patient   has difficulty leaving the   home,   to   the   administration   of   the   additional preventive   vaccines,   though   the   agency   will broaden   the requirements that currently reference COVID-19 specifically.  We urge CMS to clarify that billing for additional unexpected services  at   the   same visit  is  permitted.  For example, there   may be cases where there   is   an   adverse   reaction   to   vaccination,   or   the   clinician   observes   an   unrelated   acute   condition   needing immediate attention when the visit was initially intended only for vaccination. This would encourage adequate payment for unanticipated more intensive services and encourage physicians to address acute issues during that visit rather than scheduling a separate visit.

            "Error processing text 18:   Program  Recommendation : The AMA supports CMS’s proposal to pause implementation of the AUC Program and rescind current   program   regulations   until   modifications   can   be   made   via   regulation   or   statute   that   exempt care mandated by EMTALA; adequately address technical and workflow challenges that add to clinicians’ administrative burden and practice expenses; maximize alignment with the Quality Payment Program; and create flexibility for the consultation of physician-developed, evidence- based and transparent AUC or advanced diagnostic imaging guidelines using a mechanism best suited for their practice, specialty, and workflow. Similarly, the AMA supports CMS’s proposal to end the educational and operations testing period. In response to    raised by the AMA, CMS is proposing to pause implementation of the AUC program and rescind the current program regulations due to issues with the claims-based reporting requirements for ordering and furnishing physicians. We are glad that CMS heard the AMA’s concerns about the burden of these requirements and their potential negative impact on beneficiary access to care. CMS also cited concerns that claims would be inappropriately denied, data integrity and accuracy would be lacking, and beneficiaries would potentially be financially liable for advanced diagnostic imaging services. CMS acknowledged that many of the goals of the AUC program have been met by the QPP and other   value-based   care   initiatives,   including   the   Medicare   Shared   Savings   Program,   advances   in   electronic clinical quality measures ( eCQMs ), and interoperability requirements of the Certified Electronic Health Record Technology   (CEHRT). The   agency is also proposing   to   end the educational and operations   testing  period. The   AMA   agrees   that   the   AUC   Program   should   be   permanently   delayed   until it can   be   modified   to reduce   burden,   increase   flexibility,   and   maximize   alignment   with   the   QPP.   The   AMA   has   repeatedly raised fundamental concerns about the burden of AUC and the workflow challenges it creates, including the procedures for transmitting information from the ordering to the rendering provider, efficient reporting of the required data on claims, and understanding the complicated program requirements and exceptions. For instance, ordering physicians must be able to easily identify the diagnoses and specific advanced diagnostic imaging services to which the AUC requirements apply so that they can consult the clinical decision   support   mechanism (CDSM) at   the   time   of ordering.   Ideally,   they   would   be   prompted   to consult the CDSM upon ordering a service to which the requirements apply. Information regarding the CDSM consultation will then somehow need to be communicated between ordering and furnishing providers,   as   the   physician   ordering   the   imaging   service   in   most   cases   will   be   different   than   the   physician performing the imaging. Thus, not only must   the   claim   change   but   also all   methods   used   to send an   order (electronically or otherwise). Moreover, a standard and technological solution for transferring this information from ordering to furnishing   providers   (   ) is only in a trial implementation status and being used on a limited scale or as part of pilots, so physicians will most likely need to rely on manual workflows to exchange these data during the implementation of the AUC program. Additionally, providers will need to determine optimal procedures for these communications. For example, will ordering providers send the applicable G-codes and modifiers to the furnishing physician, or will they simply   send   the   information   in   text format   that   the   furnishing   provider will need   to   translate   into   the   code and modifier? These communications and reporting burdens will be further compounded when different providers are responsible for the technical and professional components of the imaging service, as the ordering physician will need to send the CDSM consultation information to two separate providers to be reported on the technical and professional claims. In   addition   to   the   burden   and   workflow   challenges,   the   AMA   has   raised   numerous   other   concerns   about the AUC Program, including: Medicare beneficiaries’   imaging   services would be delayed by   at   least   the   time needed   for   the furnishing provider to   contact   the ordering provider   for AUC consultation data.   Patients’ wait times   could   be   further—and   significantly—extended   in   situations   where   the   ordering   provider does not have a CDSM or is unaware of the AUC program requirements. In fact, most physicians remain unaware of the underlying program requirements. Our concerns are underscored by CMS’s prior claims analysis finding that only 9-10 percent of claims would have been paid in 2020 had AUC been in effect. Put differently, 90-91 percent of Medicare   claims   for   advanced   diagnostic   images   would   have   been   rejected   and   unpaid.   If   the   AUC   program had   been   fully   implemented   in   2020,   the   impact   on   furnishing   providers   would   have   been   nothing short of disastrous from the resulting massive cash shortfall and the administrative hassles of resubmitting denied claims. The   AUC   Program   is   not   aligned   with   the   QPP.   For   instance,   participants   in   APMs   who   are   at financial risk for their spending and quality performance should be exempt from AUC  requirements. Further, the lack of alignment between the AUC and QPP Programs extends to their differing definitions and requirements. For example, the two programs established different hardship exception   circumstances,   which   only   add   to   the   confusion   and   complexity   of   complying   with   both programs, and the AUC program requires claims-based reporting whereas MIPS and APMs are moving toward digital measures captured and reported through CEHRT. The AUC exception for suspected or confirmed medical emergencies is too narrow and subjective,   and,   as   a   result,   is   being   interpreted   to   require   emergency   physicians   to   consult   AUC. For   these   reasons,   we   urge   the   agency   to   finalize   its   proposal   to   pause   implementation   of   the   AUC program, rescind current program regulations, and end the education and operations testing period.  It is imperative that CMS work with Congress to resolve the problems stemming from the complicated AUC claims-based reporting requirements prior to un-pausing implementation. Finally, we agree with the agency that clinical decision support tools can be beneficial in assisting with clinical decision   making and their   continued use in   a   manner   that best   serves   physicians  and   their   patients should be encouraged. For this reason, as discussed in more detail later in this letter, the AMA is urging CMS to retain and modify MIPS Improvement Activity (IA) #29  Consulting AUC Using CDS When Ordering Advanced Diagnostic Imaging . Specifically, the AMA recommends that the IA provide flexibility   for   the   consultation   of   physician-developed,   evidence-based,   and   transparent   AUC   or   advanced diagnostic imaging guidelines using a mechanism best suited for their practice, specialty, and workflow.

            "Error processing text 19: Related   Medicare-Covered   Services Recommendation: CMS should regularly publish data on the impact of Medicare covered dental services on Medicare   expenditures   and   outcomes   for   inextricably   linked   Medicare-covered   clinical   services. The AMA strongly supports and agrees with CMS’s prior interpretation that it is not appropriate to incorporate budget neutrality adjustments for coverage of additional dental services into the Medicare conversion factor as CMS is merely updating existing Medicare payment policies with additional clinical scenarios.   We   further appreciate   CMS’s   clarification   in   the   2023   final rule   that   it   intends   to   “closely   study the trends in utilization and payment for these services and make refinements to the payment policy as needed in future rulemaking” (87 FR 69680). The AMA recognizes that the Medicare Trust Funds are under significant budgetary pressure and paying for more dental services may further add to concerns about the future financing of Medicare. As such, should CMS continue to add more Medicare-covered dental services each year, it is incumbent on the agency to establish a process to provide the public with regular updates on how existing and proposed services would impact Medicare expenditures. The   AMA   appreciates   CMS’s   clarification   in   the   2023   Final   MFS   that   to   receive   payment   for   professional services, medical professionals and dentists would need to be enrolled in Medicare and meet all other enrollment, compliance, and other administrative requirements for billing under the PFS, including being subject to MIPS quality reporting requirements. However, given that dental services are only covered by Medicare if they are inextricably linked and substantially related and integral to the clinical success of Medicare-covered services, the AMA believes that it is incumbent on CMS to regularly monitor and evaluate the quality and outcomes not only of newly covered dental services in their own right, but also their impact on clinical outcomes for the relevant Medicare-covered services that they are considered inextricably linked to for purposes of justifying their coverage in the first place, and to make these findings available to the public. This type of evidence might include, but is not limited to, clinically significant   improvements in quality and   safety outcomes, fewer   revisions,   fewer readmissions,   more rapid healing, quicker discharge, and quicker rehabilitation for the patient. It is critical that CMS establish a system   for regularly   publishing   this information   and understanding   the implications   of   already   finalized   services   before   it   further   expands   the   scope   of   Medicare-covered   dental services by adding new services. Clarifying   Guidance   Regarding   Coordination   with   Patient’s   Physician Recommendation: CMS should issue clarifying guidance that any Medicare-covered dental services must: 1) be ordered   by   the   physician   primarily   responsible   for   managing   that   patient’s   care   for   the   relevant Medicare-covered medical service; and 2) require follow-up by the dentist with the patient’s  physician. The AMA believes strongly that a physician-led care team is the most effective way to work collaboratively   with   multiple   providers   and   the   patient   and   family   to   accomplish   shared   goals   within   and across settings to achieve coordinated, high-quality, patient-centered care. We appreciate CMS’s clarification in the 2023 Final MFS in response to concerns raised by the AMA that an exchange of information between the physician or other medical professional and dental professional is considered necessary to   establish an   inextricable link between the   dental and covered medical   service for purposes of Medicare payment for dental services. However, it remains unclear what would qualify as “an exchange of information.” The AMA urges CMS to release clarifying guidance expressly stating that  in order to  be covered by Medicare, any dental service must: 1) be ordered by the physician primarily responsible for managing that patient’s care for their Medicare-covered medical service; and 2) require follow-up by the dentist with the patient’s physician regarding outcomes of the relevant dental procedure. This ensures appropriate coordination with multiple members of patient care teams across settings which improves patient   outcomes,   helps   to   ensure   the   patient’s   medical   record   remains   appropriately   updated,   and   helps   to ensure that dental services are in fact contributing to improved outcomes for Medicare-covered clinical services as required.

The   AMA   believes   the   Medicare   trust   funds should be closely   protected.   As such, we urge the agency to   conduct   a formal   study into the proportion of Medicare-covered dental services that are already covered by other payers that would represent a cost- shifting to Medicare, verses those that were previously uncovered and would represent an expansion in coverage and access to new populations. We believe this will provide important insights into coverage and access expansions, particularly for underserved populations, while also offering important insights into shifting cost sharing responsibilities between the federal government, state governments, and private dental insurers, which will help to guide future policies in such way that maximizes access expansions while   preserving   and protecting   the   Medicare   trust funds.

Expand on these proposals by waiving the patient deductible for HbA1c tests to encourage their uptake. The   AMA   has   long   advocated   for   and   strongly   supports   Medicare   coverage   of   the   HbA1c   test   for   diabetes and   prediabetes   screening   purposes.   Previously,   HbA1c   was   approved   for   managing,   but   not   screening   for diabetes even though it has long been used as an effective screening method and the United States Preventive   Services   Task   Force   updated   their   2015   and   2021   final   recommendations   statements   to   include the HbA1c test for diabetes screening purposes. The AMA is pleased to see this proposed change to ensure Medicare coverage remains current with the latest clinical standards and believes this change will lead   to   more frequent and   earlier screenings, and therefore more effective diabetes treatments and clinical outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, the HbA1c test does not require fasting and has fewer day-to-day variations due to stress or other illness. It is therefore often both more convenient for patients and more reliable than a fasting plasma   level   or   oral   glucose   tolerance   test.   Importantly,   covering   this   test   would   also   improve   referrals   to Medicare’s Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) given the HbA1c test is already a qualifier for that program. Lastly,  the majority of  commercial payers cover the HbA1c test for screening purposes so covering this test for diabetes screening will bring Medicare coverage in closer alignment and thereby improve equity of access for Medicare beneficiaries. The AMA appreciates CMS consulting with and being responsive to key industry voices on this issue, including the DAA, in which the AMA participates. We strongly support this proposal to cover HbA1c tests for screening purposes and urge the agency to finalize this change as proposed. Furthermore, we urge the agency to expand on this proposal by waiving the patient deductible for HbA1c tests to further encourage   the   test   for   screening   purposes   and   reduce   cost   barriers   for   Medicare   beneficiaries,   particularly those from historically minoritized and disenfranchised communities. The AMA likewise supports the proposal to expand frequency limitations for screenings to remove barriers and allow clinicians and patients to decide the appropriate interval for screening based on that individual’s clinical history and circumstances. Regular screening for diabetes is critical to early and effective   diagnosis   and   treatment   and   improved   outcomes.   Accordingly,   we   support   removing   regulatory barriers, including frequency limitations, for diabetes screening services. Recommendation: CMS should finalize proposals to streamline the definition of diabetes by removing codified clinical   test   requirements,   which   are   currently   required   for   diabetes   screening,   Medical   Nutrition Therapy (MNT), and Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT) services. The   AMA   supports   this   change,   which   would   align   the   definition   of   diabetes   across   lines   of   service   and create more flexibility to adapt to evolving clinical standards in the future.

In   addition,   the   agency   should   finalize   additional   changes   to   further   strengthen   and   expand   access to DSMT and MNT services, including allowing MNT and DSMT to be delivered on the same day, eliminating patient cost-sharing, and reimbursing for MNT services for individuals with  prediabetes. The AMA supports regulatory changes that mitigate barriers and improve access to DSMT and MNT services while ensuring services are appropriately performed via telehealth given the patient’s individual needs and the latest clinical standards, guidelines, and best practices.

Reimbursing   for MNT services for individuals with prediabetes for example has been shown in numerous studies to decrease   fasting   blood   glucose,   body   weight,   blood   pressure,   and   waist   circumference   for   patients   who received the intervention for at least 3 months.

The AMA also urges   CMS   to   continue   paying   for   OTP   provision   of   take-home   naloxone   whether   for   prescription or over-the-counter products. In previous rulemaking, CMS extended the ability for OTPs to furnish periodic assessments via audio- only   communication   technology   through   2023.   To   align   the   OTP   policies   with   the   telehealth   provisions   of the CAA, 2023, CMS is proposing to extend this policy on audio-only periodic assessments through   2024. For all the reasons cited in the Proposed Rule supporting the 2023 extension, the AMA supports   this further extension through 2024. The AMA also appreciates that the HCPCS codes for office-based treatment   of   opioid   use   disorder   (G2086,   G2087,   and   G2088)   are   permanently   on   the   Medicare   Telehealth List and that the list indicates that these services may be provided via audio-only communication  technology. In the 2023 MFS final rule, CMS finalized the rates for bundled episodes of care for OUD services provided   through OTPs   to   reflect   more   resources devoted to psychotherapy, specifically   by basing the payment   rate     by   prescription.   Recent   FDA   approval   of   some   naloxone   products   being   available   over the counter is an important means of increasing patient access to these lifesaving drugs. It is critical that CMS not discontinue paying for the take-home supplies provided by OTPs just because they may be available without a prescription.

CMS is soliciting comments on whether gaps in its coverage and payment policies exist for intensive outpatient SUD treatment furnished by intensive outpatient programs. In June 2021, the Legal Action Center published a paper in the journal    that describes this gap in SUD treatment in the Medicare program. According to this paper, intermediate levels of SUD care are more intensive than office-based   outpatient   counseling   but   less   intensive   than   inpatient   hospitalization.   This   includes   intensive outpatient,   partial   hospitalization,   and   residential   treatment.   The   authors   state   that   this   type   of   care   is   often used as a step down for people who no longer need to be hospitalized but cannot be discharged safely, or as a step   up for those who need   more services and supports than can be provided   in   the office setting. The authors also note that Medicare does cover comparable rehabilitation programs for patients with other medical conditions, such as Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility services, but does not have comparable programs for SUD treatment. The AMA encourages CMS to fill this gap in care.  Electronic   Prescribing   of   Controlled   Substances   (EPCS)  Recommendation: The   AMA\n",

This is to maintain the feasibility of administering these drugs in office-based settings, preventing potential shifts to more expensive and less accessible hospital-affiliated infusion  centers. Reimbursement   Policies   for   Administration   of   Complex   Non-Chemotherapeutic   Drugs The AMA is pleased to see the increased focus on appropriate reimbursement for complex non- chemotherapeutic   drug   administration.   The   AMA   initially   contacted   CMS   about   this   issue   in   July   2022, when it came to our attention that several Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) were   downcoding  certain drug administrative services while also disallowing stakeholder input on the coding and reimbursement changes. It is critical that CMS provide both adequate reimbursement for these physician services while also providing adequate coding and coverage guidance. We also urge CMS to ensure   that   all   MACs   operate   in   a   manner   which   ensures   maximum   transparency   and   clear   opportunity   for stakeholder input on actions that ultimately impact coverage and reimbursement for physician services. The AMA has serious concerns that reimbursement policies for the administration of complex non- chemotherapeutic drug administration, including  downcoding  of these services by MACs, is medically inappropriate and will ultimately impact physician’s ability to administer these critical therapeutics to patient   in   office-based   settings.   The   therapeutics   at   issue   require   multiple   staff   with   specialized   training   to administer, along with specialized equipment and systems. The coding and reimbursement policies proposed by many MACs last year would result in a situation where  a number of  practices would no longer be able to employ the staff or maintain the systems necessary to administer these treatments to patients, forcing them to other sites for care. If   payment,   coding,   and   coverage   guidance   is   not   appropriately   updated   for   these   services,   we   may   face   a situation where it is no longer financially feasible for physicians to administer these therapeutics to patients in an office setting, forcing patients to receive care at what would likely be more expensive hospital-affiliated infusion centers. This is untenable for  a number of  reasons, including the additional significant burdens placed on patients to switch care settings and the significantly increased costs associated with hospital-based care. Additionally, not every hospital is well-equipped to provide these services. Should a patient reside in an area where there is no hospital-affiliated option, they may experience significant disruption to their care. The AMA strongly urges CMS to engage directly with impacted physician and patient groups to determine appropriate reimbursement policies that maintain access to these critical drug administration services. In addition to providing clear reimbursement policies for these covered services, CMS should ensure that processes utilized by MACs in issuing local coverage determinations and local coverage articles are appropriate, transparent, and provide the necessary opportunity to stakeholder input. Last year, several problems   arose   with   respect   to   these   services   after   MACs   issued   Local   Coverage   Articles   that   directed   the  downcoding  of these services then refused additional opportunity for discussion or evidence submission from interested parties,   including physicians rendering   these services. CMS   must ensure that changes this impactful on physicians and patients are afforded appropriate and transparent processes by which those changed are made.

The AMA supports the proposed delay, through Jan. 1, 2025, of the requirement that only the physician   or practitioner who spends more than half of the total time with the patient during a split or shared visit can bill for the visit. In its rationale for a delay, CMS cited    raised by the AMA and organized medicine   about   the   disruptions   to   team-based   care   in   the   facility   setting   that   would   result   from   this   policy. CMS also noted that the AMA CPT Editorial Panel is considering revisions to aspects of split or shared visits, which are final as of Sept. 1, 2023.  Therefore, we strongly urge CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for determining when a physician may report the E/M service and to implement this policy following the one-year delay, effective Jan. 1, 2025, to give physicians and practitioners sufficient time to incorporate this guidance into their clinical practice. The   new   CPT   guidance  states: Physician(s) and other qualified health care professional(s) (QHP[s]) may act as a team in providing care for the patient, working together during a single E/M service. The split or shared visits guidelines are applied to determine which professional may report the service. If the physician or other QHP performs a substantive portion of the encounter, the physician or other QHP may report the service. If   code selection is based   on total   time on   the date   of   the encounter, the   service   is   reported   by   the   professional who   spent   the   majority   of the   face-to-face   or   non-face- to-face   time performing   the   service.  For   the purpose of   reporting E/M services within the context of team-based   care,   performance of a substantive   part   of the   MDM requires that   the physician(s) or other QHP(s) made or approved the management plan for the number and complexity of problems addressed at the encounter and takes responsibility for that plan with its inherent risk of complications and/or morbidity or mortality of patient management. By doing so, a physician or other QHP has performed two of the three elements used in the selection of the code level based on MDM. If the amount and/or complexity of data to be reviewed and analyzed is used by the physician or other QHP to determine the reported code level, assessing an independent historian’s narrative and the ordering or review of tests or documents do not have to be personally performed by the physician or other QHP, because the relevant items would be considered in formulating the management plan. Independent interpretation of tests and discussion of management plan or test interpretation must be personally performed by the physician   or   other   QHP   if   these   are   used   to   determine   the   reported   code   level   by   the   physician   or other QHP. These guidelines were developed by the CPT Editorial Panel with input from the CPT/RUC Workgroup on E/M, which is comprised of current and former members of both the CPT Editorial Panel and RUC and has a distinguished track record of significant collaboration among state medical and specialty societies in developing a framework for the revised E/M services that have been implemented by Medicare   across   health   care   settings.   CPT   terminology   is   the   most   widely   accepted   medical   nomenclature used across the country for E/M and all other medical services under public and private health insurance programs. Adoption of CPT guidelines for split or shared visits would reduce the ambiguity around how to report these codes since CMS revoked its previous definition of “substantive portion” and would ensure consistency and uniformity across the health care system. Importantly, adoption of this guidance would allow physicians or QHPs to report  split  or shared visits   based   on   time   or   medical   decision-making.   The   AMA   supports   physician-led,   team-based   patient care. Patients benefit from the collaboration of physicians and QHPs who care for patients in hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and other facilities, where they work  hand-in-hand . However, reporting only based on the physician or QHP who performs more than 50 percent of the total time of the visit will disincentivize the continuation of these care relationships. There is significant variability in how much time it takes to perform elements of the visit based on the level of training and expertise of the physician and QHP. For many patient visits, the medical decision making involved in directing the management of the patient’s care determines the course of treatment for the patient but may not require the most time. Just   as   is   the   case   now,   the   physician   or   QHP   who   performs   these   critical   elements   of   the   visit   should   be able   to adequately   report   the scenario   that is best for   their   patient.  For these reasons, we strongly urge CMS to adopt the CPT guidelines for reporting split or shared visits. \"\"\"\n",

        "topicData = ['Request for Information (RFI): Drugs and Biologicals that are Not Usually Self-Administered by the Patient, and Complex Drug Administration Coding', 'The ACR applauds CMS’s undertaking to conduct a comprehensive review of the administration of biologicals not usually self-administered by the patient and complex drug administration coding, issues that have posed significant challenges to rheumatologists and other specialists in the House of Medicine. The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater.

            "['Request for Information (RFI): Drugs and Biologicals that are Not Usually Self-Administered by the Patient, and Complex Drug Administration Coding', 'The ACR applauds CMS’s undertaking to conduct a comprehensive review of the administration of biologicals not usually self-administered by the patient and complex drug administration coding, issues that have posed significant challenges to rheumatologists and other specialists in the House of Medicine. The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices.

        "topicData = ['Request for Information (RFI): Drugs and Biologicals that are Not Usually Self-Administered by the Patient, and Complex Drug Administration Coding', 'The ACR applauds CMS’s undertaking to conduct a comprehensive review of the administration of biologicals not usually self-administered by the patient and complex drug administration coding, issues that have posed significant challenges to rheumatologists and other specialists in the House of Medicine. The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.', 'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.', '“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code. The advent and evolution of biologics and other immunomodulating therapies have revolutionized outcomes for patients with auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and vasculitis, which carry significant morbidity, mortality, and associated healthcare and societal costs. Despite the up-front costs, adding biologics to other treatment modalities has been cost-effective in appropriate patient populations.1', 'The American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) states, “Chemotherapy administration codes 96401-96549 apply to parenteral administration of non- radionuclide antineoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic agents provided for treatment of noncancer diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to substances such as certain monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic response modifiers.” Yet, the MACs continue to utilize unsubstantiated criteria to determine which drugs should be defined as complex and warrant the use of complex administration codes.', 'In 2013, the American College of Rheumatology released its position outlining the common clinical situations that require the use of intravenous biologics as opposed to self-administered biologics and outlined the FDA indications, appropriate use, safety, and off-label use for biologics, which are far more complicated at the molecular level than traditional chemically synthesized drugs.2 Also, based on the evolution of biologics and monoclonal antibody treatments on the market for auto-immune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology, infectious disease, dermatology, neurology, and other key areas of medicine, it is appropriate to review the definition of “chemotherapy,” which is no longer a useful term, as indications and toxicity should distinguish drugs. The CPT manual also states that “The highly complex infusion of chemotherapy or other drug or biologic agents requires a physician or other qualified health care professional work and/or clinical staff monitoring well beyond that of therapeutic drug agents (96360-96379) because the incidence of severe adverse patient reactions are typically greater. These services can be provided by any physician or other qualified health care professional.” Accordingly, the ACR’s position statement indicates that given the complexity associated with the design, manufacturing, and storage of biologics and differences over time in the structure, efficacy, and safety of biologics, these treatments should be supervised and carried out by specially trained physicians and advanced practitioners who have the required knowledge, training, and experience to administer biologic agents and monitor adverse reactions. The ACR recommends that CPT work with the key stakeholders to change the terminology in the manual from “chemotherapy” to “immunomodulatory” therapies, which is more in line with drug indications.', 'As a reminder, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) Congress included language allowing the use of the chemotherapy administration code by physicians who administer non-oncologic medications in their offices. The policy also indicated that the same level of supervision was required, and there are no significant differences between earlier biologics and currently proposed biologics in their level of risk in administration. Another key point in the MMA also outlined that these treatments should cost the same to administer, including clinical labor costs, and that no specialty should be reimbursed more than the other. Unfortunately, this has also caused another issue in how “chemotherapy” is assigned with the J-codes versus monoclonal antibody and biologic therapies through HCPCS. There are more than one example of a particular drug used as cancer therapy and an immunomodulator to treat different types of arthritis and vasculitis. To reimburse differently based on specialty is not consistent with the MMA language. Also, the toxicity issues related to these infusions do not differ based on the indication of use.', 'There has been a great deal of progress in the use of biologics in many disciplines, with the expectation for continuous advancement in the future. The ACR believes that policies related to access and reimbursement for biologic treatment should be transparent and prioritize the well-being and health of patients across disease processes with a focus on reducing morbidity and mortality. We recommend that the agency convene stakeholder roundtables or workgroups to explore regulatory and legislative solutions to these policies to avoid unintended consequences with deleterious impacts on access and coverage for beneficiaries and their healthcare team.', 'Self-Administered Drug (SAD) List Reimbursement is inadequate for drugs and biologics placed on the existing Self-Administered Drug (SAD) exclusion list policy, and the process used to determine if a drug is usually self-administered by the patient lacks transparency. The ACR is deeply concerned about barriers that limit the ability of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune diseases to obtain affordable, high-quality, high-value healthcare, which includes appropriate treatment. Additionally, beneficiaries who lose access to medication by virtue of inclusion on the SAD list are at risk of delay and deprivation of therapeutic benefits. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States, and modern treatment approaches have revolutionized outcomes for patients with these diseases. Early aggressive therapy with various drugs, including biologics, has been shown to reduce joint damage and deformities and improve function, reducing work absenteeism, disability, death, costly procedures/surgeries, and hospitalizations.', \"The ACR affirms the ethical responsibility of the healthcare team to place the welfare of the patient above all other considerations, as well as the importance of safeguarding the patient's relationship with their healthcare team. The ACR’s goal is to preserve patients’ access to care from rheumatology specialty care teams and the therapies necessary to treat their rheumatologic conditions. The ACR believes this is an important opportunity for CMS to work with the rheumatology community and other key stakeholders as trusted voices on the critical issue of an equitable approach to the criteria for the SAD list and the billing of the complex administration services, especially as it applies to inadvertent harmful consequences related to poor access to future medications.\"]\n",

The ACR believes the critical components of providing best practice treatments options with biologics and immunomodulatory therapies and protecting the patient and care team relationship are at the highest level of ethical responsibility to our patients and their access to quality healthcare in treating their rheumatologic conditions.\\', \\'CMS plays a crucial role in working with the specialties affected by these policies to identify long- term solutions to the current issues of down coding for services billed for the administration of biologics and the drugs added to the Self-Administered Drug (SAD) list. The ACR is concerned that the criteria used for these two policies contradict the proposed nondiscrimination rules created for Medicare Fee-for-Service.\\', \\'“Downcoding” The downcoding of complex chemotherapy services has reached a deep concern as it relates to the billing of biologics for the treatment of most non-oncologic conditions. This is mainly due to flawed billing and coding articles created by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) that have restricted which complex therapies will be reimbursed using the “chemotherapy” administration codes, forcing rheumatologists and other specialists (except for hematology and oncology) to bill these services with the therapeutic drug administration code.

            "\n",
            "1. Improved Efficiency: Low latency enables real-time communication and decision-making, which can significantly improve the efficiency of logistics operations. For example, in a warehouse, low latency can help ensure that orders are picked, packed, and shipped quickly and accurately.\n",
            "2. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: In today's fast-paced world, customers expect quick and reliable delivery of their orders. Low latency in LLMs can help ensure that products are delivered on time, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n",
            "3. Better Inventory Management: Low latency can help improve inventory management by enabling real-time tracking of inventory levels and locations. This can help prevent stockouts, overstocking, and other inventory-related issues.\n",
            "4. Competitive Advantage: In many industries, low latency can provide a competitive advantage. By responding quickly to changes in demand and supply, companies can gain an edge over their competitors.\n",
            "5. Reduced Costs: Low latency can help reduce costs by minimizing delays and streamlining logistics operations. For example, by reducing the time it takes to process orders, companies can reduce labor costs and improve asset utilization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, low latency is critical in LLMs because it enables real-time communication, decision-making, and response times, which can significantly improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and competitiveness of logistics operations.\n"
